# Lack of Handling for Single-Hop Swaps in `swapExactInput` Function
## Summary
The `swapExactInput` function in the provided Solidity contract does not handle single-hop swaps properly when there's only one liquidity pool involved in the token swap path. This can lead to unintended behavior where the output tokens are sent to the contract itself instead of the intended recipient.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `swapExactInput` function is designed to facilitate both single-hop and multi-hop swaps with an exact input amount of a token. However, it has an issue when there's only one liquidity pool in the token swap path. The primary problem lies in the assumption that there are always intermediate swaps, causing the recipient address to be set to the contract (`address(this)`) during each iteration of the loop. This custody arrangement is intended for multi-hop swaps but becomes problematic for single-hop swaps.

Code Snippet (Problematic Section):
```solidity
bool hasMultiplePools = params.path.hasMultiplePools();

while (hasMultiplePools) {
    // Intermediate swap logic here
    // ...
    source = address(this); // Contract custody for intermediate swaps
    params.path = params.path.skipToken();
    hasMultiplePools = params.path.hasMultiplePools();
}

// Final swap
amountOut = _swapExactInputInternal(
    params.amountIn,
    params.recipient,
    0,
    SwapCallbackData({path: params.path, source: source})
);
```
In this code, the contract assumes the existence of multiple pools (`hasMultiplePools`) and sets the recipient to the contract address (`address(this)`) for custody purposes. This works correctly for multi-hop swaps but becomes problematic for single-hop swaps because the output tokens are eventually sent to the contract itself instead of the intended recipient.
## Impact
The impact of this issue is that it can result in a loss of tokens for users conducting single-hop swaps. Tokens that should have been transferred to the user's specified recipient are instead held by the contract, causing unintended behavior and potential financial loss.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure proper handling of both single-hop and multi-hop swaps, the swapExactInput function should be modified as follows:
```solidity
function swapExactInput(ExactInputParams memory params)
    external
    payable
    override
    onlyNotExpired(params.deadline)
    returns (uint256 amountOut)
{
    address source = msg.sender; // msg.sender is the source of tokenIn for the first swap

    bool hasMultiplePools = params.path.hasMultiplePools();

    while (hasMultiplePools) {
        params.amountIn = _swapExactInputInternal(
            params.amountIn,
            address(this), // Contract custody for intermediate swaps
            0,
            SwapCallbackData({path: params.path.getFirstPool(), source: source})
        );

        source = address(this); // Contract custody for intermediate swaps
        params.path = params.path.skipToken();
        hasMultiplePools = params.path.hasMultiplePools();
    }

    // Perform the final swap with the intended recipient
    amountOut = _swapExactInputInternal(
        params.amountIn,
        params.recipient,
        0,
        SwapCallbackData({path: params.path, source: source})
    );

    require(amountOut >= params.minAmountOut, 'Router: insufficient amountOut');
}
```
