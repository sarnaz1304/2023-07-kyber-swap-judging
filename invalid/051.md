# LPs cannot withdraw RTokens when whitelist is enabled
## Summary

If someone sets up a position on a Pool directly, and then later the whitelist is enabled, they cannot withdraw their RTokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Bob creates a position on a Pool directly
2. The protocol owner enables the whitelist. Now people can only create new positions on the pool via a PositionManager
3. Bob can no longer call tweakPosZeroLiq to withdraw his RTokens.

This seems to be an oversight as burn() and burnRTokens() are both available even when the whitelist is enabled.

## Impact

People can't withdraw their RTokens

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L585

When the whitelist is enabled, tweakPosZeroLiq can only be called by whitelisted addresses.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow tweakPosZeroLiq to be called even with the whitelist enabled.
