# BasePositionManager and AntiSnipAttackPositionManager do not reimburse user on removeLiquidity
## Summary

When `BasePositionManager.removeLiquidity()` or `AntiSnipAttackPositionManager.removeLiquidity()` are called, they remove liquidity from the pool by calling `pool.burn()` which sends `token0` and `token1` back to the position manager. However, they do not send the tokens back to the position manager's caller and tokens are left in the contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

When removing liquidity from a position, pool will send tokens to position manager and position manager will not reimburse users. Users need to call `transferAllTokens()` to receive their tokens back. However this can be called by anyone to withdraw the tokens from the contract without any protection:

```solidity
  function transferAllTokens(
    address token,
    uint256 minAmount,
    address recipient
  ) public payable virtual override {
    uint256 balanceToken = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balanceToken >= minAmount, 'Insufficient token');

    if (balanceToken > 0) {
      TokenHelper.transferToken(IERC20(token), balanceToken, address(this), recipient);
    }
  }
```

## Impact

Users removing liquidity from a position may lose all their tokens used to provide liquidity.

This is also the case for `burnRTokens()` which burns the reinvestment tokens on the pool and does not return the token0 and token1 received to the user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Reimburse the users tokens in `removeLiquidity()`.
