# Governance/fee recipient has no slippage protection when burning rTokens
## Summary

Governance/fee recipient are minted fees directly with every swap. This means they are forced to burn rTokens directly with the pool. In this scenario they don't have any slippage protection because they aren't burning through a position manager, which can lead to excess impermanent loss when burning during times of high volatility.

## Vulnerability Detail

[Pool.sol#L287-L292](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L287-L292)

    _burn(msg.sender, _qty);

    if (qty0 > 0) token0.safeTransfer(msg.sender, qty0);
    if (qty1 > 0) token1.safeTransfer(msg.sender, qty1);

    emit BurnRTokens(msg.sender, _qty, qty0, qty1);

As seen above there is no slippage protection when burning directly from the pool. Additionally there isn't even a way to enforce a deadline. This leave those burning directly from the pool (such as governance) with no way to prevent slippage.

[BasePositionManager.sol#L242-L246](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/periphery/BasePositionManager.sol#L242-L246)

  function burnRTokens(BurnRTokenParams calldata params)
    external
    override
    isAuthorizedForToken(params.tokenId)
    onlyNotExpired(params.deadline)

[BasePositionManager.sol#L266](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/periphery/BasePositionManager.sol#L266)

    require(amount0 >= params.amount0Min && amount1 >= params.amount1Min, 'Low return amounts');

This is in complete contrast to the protections given by position managers which have both deadline verification and min amounts.

## Impact

Governance and anyone else who burns directly from the pool have no way to limit slippage

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow rTokens to be burned via the router to grant these extra protections
