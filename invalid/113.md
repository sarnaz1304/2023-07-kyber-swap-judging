# Token 1 and swapFeeUnits is not checked for non-zero value
## Summary
The token1 is not checked which could lead to unexpected issue

## Vulnerability Detail
tickDistance is derived from the SwapFeeUnits and according to the code, which could lead to loss of data as parameters is being overwritten by new createPool calls and the non-zero token would cause unexpected behaviours in the _create function implementation.

## Impact
Pool not being created or created but unusable with unexpected behaviours

## Code Snippet
```solidity
require(tokenA != tokenB, 'identical tokens');
    (address token0, address token1) = tokenA < tokenB ? (tokenA, tokenB) : (tokenB, tokenA);
    require(token0 != address(0), 'null address');
    int24 tickDistance = feeAmountTickDistance[swapFeeUnits];
    require(tickDistance != 0, 'invalid fee');
    require(getPool[token0][token1][swapFeeUnits] == address(0), 'pool exists');

    parameters.factory = address(this);
    parameters.poolOracle = poolOracle;
    parameters.token0 = token0;
    parameters.token1 = token1;
    parameters.swapFeeUnits = swapFeeUnits;
    parameters.tickDistance = tickDistance;

    pool = _create(bytes(''), keccak256(abi.encode(token0, token1, swapFeeUnits)));
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a zero value check for token1 and swapFeeUnits
