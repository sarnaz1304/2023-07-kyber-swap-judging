# Reentrancy vulnerability - lock mechanism
## Summary
This report highlights a potential reentrancy vulnerability within the smart contract under review. The contract's locking mechanism might not offer complete protection against reentrancy attacks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract employs a `lock()` modifier to prevent reentrancy by locking the contract state during the execution of certain functions. While this demonstrates an effort to mitigate reentrancy risks, the current implementation may be inadequate to provide comprehensive protection.
## Impact
The identified vulnerability could allow malicious actors to exploit reentrancy, potentially leading to unauthorized manipulation of the contract's state. The vulnerability might expose the contract to various risks, including fund loss, incorrect function execution, and unexpected behavior.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
modifier lock() {
    require(poolData.locked == false, 'locked');
    poolData.locked = true;
    _;
    poolData.locked = false;
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
It is advised to perform a thorough review of the locking mechanism implemented within the `lock()` modifier. Consider implementing more advanced reentrancy prevention patterns, such as the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern, to ensure robust protection against reentrancy attacks. Engaging professional security auditors is highly recommended to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities effectively.
## Possible Scenario (Critical)
An attacker who is knowledgeable about reentrancy vulnerabilities might identify a potential window of opportunity within the locking mechanism. In a scenario where an attacker calls a function that uses the `lock()` modifier, they could quickly execute another transaction before the modifier's state changes take effect. By doing so, the attacker could bypass the lock and potentially exploit the contract's state in a way not intended by the original design. This scenario is particularly dangerous if executed by a skilled attacker, as it might expose the contract to severe risks.
