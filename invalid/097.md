# Order of Operations in calculation lead to  Underflow and unexpected and incorrect value
## Summary

the order of operations when calculating `feesClaimable` and `feesLockedNew.` exactly , if feesClaimable is calculated to be greater than totalFees, subtracting it from totalFees can result in an underflow. this Operation  can lead to an unexpected and incorrect value for `feesLockedNew`

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the vulnerable part in code: 
```solidity 
function calcFeeProportions(
    uint256 currentFees,
    uint256 nextFees,
    uint256 currentClaimableFeeUnits,
    uint256 nextClaimableFeeUnits
  ) internal pure returns (uint256 feesLockedNew, uint256 feesClaimable) {
    uint256 totalFees = currentFees + nextFees;
    feesClaimable =
      (currentClaimableFeeUnits * currentFees + nextClaimableFeeUnits * nextFees) /
      C.FEE_UNITS;
    feesLockedNew = totalFees - feesClaimable;
  }
}
```
More details letâ€™s say that totalFees is calculated as the sum of currentFees and nextFees, which is straightforward and good, we have the feesClaimable is calculated as follows `feesClaimable = (currentClaimableFeeUnits * currentFees + nextClaimableFeeUnits * nextFees) / C.FEE_UNITS;`
This calculation is determines how much of the total fees can be claimed, the problem is  here. 
If the numerator `(currentClaimableFeeUnits* currentFees + nextClaimableFeeUnits * nextFees) ` becomes greater than or equal to `C.FEE_UNITS,` it will result in `feesClaimable` being calculated as a value greater than `totalFees.`
And we have the feesLockedNew is calculated as the difference between totalFees and feesClaimable. If feesClaimable is greater than totalFees, subtracting it will lead to an underflow, resulting in an incorrect and unexpected value for feesLockedNew. 
here is a scenario: 
Suppose totalFees is 1000, and feesClaimable is calculated to be 1200 due to the order of operations. In this case:

```solidity 
feesLockedNew = 1000 - 1200 = -200
```
So the result that the  negative value for feesLockedNew is incorrect and can lead to unintended consequences in the contract logic. 
## Impact
This issue can lead to a situation where feesClaimable becomes larger than totalFees, which is not logically possible.
When an underflow occurs during the subtraction, it results in an unexpected and incorrect value for feesLockedNew. The value of feesLockedNew could be a very large positive number, which is not a valid representation of fees locked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This fix can done by ensure that feesClaimable does not exceed totalFees as an example: 

```solidity 
uint256 totalFees = currentFees + nextFees;
uint256 feesClaimable;

//Check if feesClaimable would exceed totalFees
if (currentClaimableFeeUnits * currentFees >= nextClaimableFeeUnits * nextFees) {
    feesClaimable = totalFees;  // Set feesClaimable to totalFees
} else {
    feesClaimable = (currentClaimableFeeUnits * currentFees + nextClaimableFeeUnits * nextFees) / C.FEE_UNITS;
}

uint256 feesLockedNew = totalFees - feesClaimable;
```
