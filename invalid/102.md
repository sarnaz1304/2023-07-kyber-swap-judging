# Exploitable Allowance Front-running in mint Function Due to Absence of Whitelist Checks
## Summary
The mint function in the Pool.sol contract, when the whitelistDisabled is equal to true at the factory contract, exposes a vulnerability. If a user grants an allowance to the BasePositionManager, an attacker can exploit this by directly invoking the mint function, setting the data.source to the user's address and effectively minting tokens for themselves at the user's expense.

## Vulnerability Detail
The mint function in the Pool.sol contract can mint tokens based on allowances provided to the BasePositionManager. Here's the attack sequence:

A user provides an allowance to the BasePositionManager with the intention of minting tokens.
Before the user's intended mint transaction is processed, an attacker directly calls the mint function in the Pool.sol contract.
The attacker sets the data.source parameter to the user's address, effectively using the user's granted allowance.
The attacker mints tokens to their own address, misusing the user's funds.

This vulnerability arises due to the whitelistChecks not being present at this case, meaning anyone could be able to call Pool.mint function.

## Impact
Unauthorized Minting: Malicious actors can exploit granted allowances, leading to unauthorized minting of tokens for themselves.
Loss of User Funds: Users granting allowances to the BasePositionManager risk having their allowances exploited without their consent.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Re-evaluate the Necessity of whitelistDisabled: Consider whether the feature is essential for the protocol's functionality. If it's not frequently used, it might be safer to remove or replace it with a more secure alternative.
Enhanced Checks: If keeping the feature, introduce additional checks in the Pool.sol contract's mint function, especially when whitelistDisabled is true.
