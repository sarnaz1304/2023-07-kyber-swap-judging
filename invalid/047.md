# [Medium]The remaining ETH may be locked in the contract after call
## Summary
After calling an external contract and forwards some ETH value, the contract balance should be checked. If there is excess eth left over due to a failed call, or more eth being delivered than needed, or any other reason, this eth must be refunded to the user or handled appropriately, otherwise the eth may be frozen in the contract forever.

## Impact
The remaining ETH may be locked in the contract after call
## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function transferEth(address receiver, uint256 amount) internal {
    if (receiver == address(this)) return;
    (bool success, ) = payable(receiver).call{value: amount}('');
    require(success, 'transfer eth failed');
  }
```
```solidity
function rescueFund(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    if (token == address(0)) {
      (bool success, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: amount}('');
      require(success, "failed to collect native");
    } else {
      IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(owner(), amount);
    }
    emit OwnerWithdrew(owner(), token, amount);
  }
```

Manual Review
## Recommendation
 The contract balance should be checked after sending the eth.
