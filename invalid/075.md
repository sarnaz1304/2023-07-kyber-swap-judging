# Lack of slippage protection in `burnRTokens`
## Summary
The `burnRTokens()` function in the `Pool.sol` lacks slippage protection. As a result, users might experience a discrepancy in expected versus actual tokens received due to volatile price changes.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the `burnRTokens` function, the amount of `token0` and `token1` that a user receives upon burning rTokens is determined based on the `sqrtP` (representing `sqrtPrice`). If the `sqrtP` is susceptible to rapid fluctuations, users might not receive the amount they anticipate. Without an implemented mechanism to ensure that the difference between the expected and actual amounts (due to price fluctuations) remains within acceptable bounds, users might suffer significant financial losses.

## Impact
Without slippage protection:
1. Users might not receive the expected amount of tokens when burning rTokens.
2. Users can potentially exploit rapid price changes, leading to an imbalanced or unfair distribution of assets.
3. A loss of user trust in the protocol as unexpected financial losses can result from regular interactions.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L259-L293

```solidity
function burnRTokens(uint256 _qty, bool isLogicalBurn)
    external
    override
    lock
    returns (uint256 qty0, uint256 qty1) {
    ...
    uint160 sqrtP = poolData.sqrtP;
    ...
    qty0 = QtyDeltaMath.getQty0FromBurnRTokens(sqrtP, deltaL);
    qty1 = QtyDeltaMath.getQty1FromBurnRTokens(sqrtP, deltaL);
    ...
    if (qty0 > 0) token0.safeTransfer(msg.sender, qty0);
    if (qty1 > 0) token1.safeTransfer(msg.sender, qty1);
    ...
}
```

## Recommendation
To protect against price slippage, consider implementing the following measures:

1. Allow users to specify a maximum acceptable slippage.
2. Compare the calculated `qty0` and `qty1` values against user-defined minimums.
