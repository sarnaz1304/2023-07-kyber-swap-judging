# Steal fees from protocol
## Summary
A bad actor can steal fees from protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the protocol, users can add liquidity and also exchange one token for another. However, a bad actor can exploit the system by monitoring transactions in the mempool (the pool of pending transactions). When they detect a user's intention to swap from token A to token B, they can front-run this transaction. Specifically, they add liquidity within the tickLower and tickUpper price range just before the user's swap is executed. Once the user's transaction goes through, the bad actor receives the transaction fees due to the added liquidity. Afterward, they quickly remove their liquidity, securing a profit. 

## Impact
Someone can unlawfully take the transaction fees that belong to a specific system or platform
