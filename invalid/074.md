# `Pool` contract applies slippage to sqrtPrice which is wrong and leads to unpredictable slippage
## Summary 
Swapping in `Pool.sol` contract leverages the square root of the price (`sqrtPrice`) instead of the actual price. In `swap()` function slippage is directly applied to this `sqrtPrice`, resulting in unpredictable and often greater-than-intended slippage rates.

## Vulnerability Detail
The code in `swap()#Pool.sol` applies the `limitSqrtP` directly to the `sqrtPrice`. As a consequence, the resultant slippage limit is inadvertently magnified.

```solidity
    if (willUpTick) {
      require(
        limitSqrtP > swapData.sqrtP && limitSqrtP < TickMath.MAX_SQRT_RATIO,
        'bad limitSqrtP'
      );
    } else {
      require(
        limitSqrtP < swapData.sqrtP && limitSqrtP > TickMath.MIN_SQRT_RATIO,
        'bad limitSqrtP'
      );
    }
```

Assuming a user set slippage to 5%, and the `sqrtPrice` is 10 (resulting in an actual price of 100). Applying a 5% slippage directly to the `sqrtPrice` brings it to 4. However, the squared value of this gives 81, representing a real slippage of 19%, not the intended 5% from the user.

## Impact
The unintentional increase in slippage limits.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rather than applying slippage directly to the `sqrtPrice`, it should be applied to the actual price to maintain the desired limit.
