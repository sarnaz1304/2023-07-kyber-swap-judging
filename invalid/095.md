# Use native account abstraction over ecrecover for validation on the zkSync
## Summary
Use native account abstraction over ecrecover for validation on zkSync.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the description in the document, the contracts are supposed to be deployed to any EVM-compatible chains.The zkSync Era is the first EVM-compatible chain to implement native account abstraction. The accounts in the zkSync Era can initiate transactions like Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs), but they can also implement any logic within them, like smart contracts. This feature is known as “Account Abstraction” (AA). Therefore, when performing signature verification, one should not rely on the fact that the account has an ECDSA private key, as the account may be managed by multi-signatures and use other signature schemes.

It is recommend  to use native account abstraction over ecrecover for validation.

```solidity
 require(spender != owner, 'ERC721Permit: approval to current owner');

    if (Address.isContract(owner)) {
      require(
        IERC1271(owner).isValidSignature(digest, abi.encodePacked(r, s, v)) == 0x1626ba7e,
        'Unauthorized'
      );
    } else {
      address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);
      require(recoveredAddress != address(0), 'Invalid signature');
      require(recoveredAddress == owner, 'Unauthorized');
    }
```

## Impact
Some accounts using different signatures might be unusable
