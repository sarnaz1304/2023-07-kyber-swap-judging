# SnipAttack safeguards distribute snipped fees in a way that can still be abused
## Summary

When a snip attack is blocked, the rTokens minted to the attacker are burned. This effectively distributes the captured fees to all rToken holders. The problem with this is that the fees should have been distributed to liquidity that is in range. With the right preparation this can actually make it more profitable for the attacker instead of less. If the attacker is able to accrue a large number of rTokens they can still effectively steal fees from in range liquidity.

## Vulnerability Detail

[Pool.sol#L260-L271](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L260-L271)

    function burnRTokens(uint256 _qty, bool isLogicalBurn)
      external
      override
      lock
      returns (uint256 qty0, uint256 qty1)
    {
      if (isLogicalBurn) {
        _burn(msg.sender, _qty);
  
        emit BurnRTokens(msg.sender, _qty, 0, 0);
        return (0, 0);
    }

When rTokens are burned as a result of snip attack safeguards being triggered, the burned rTokens do not qualify for any fees. This maintains the same amount of "liquidity" while decreasing the number of eligible tokens. The result of this is that all burned fees are effectively distributed to all rToken holders. The issue is that the fees should actually belong to in range liquidity. This allows malicious users to still exploit snip attacks in a roundabout manner. 

Assume an attacker is able collect a large number of rTokens. This can be accomplished by depositing single tick liquidity then swapping repeatedly in it. Assume they own 75% of the total supply. Now they can profit large amounts from snipping attacks. When the rTokens generated during the attack are burned, they still receive 75% of the profits because they own 75% of the rTokens. Due to this effective monopoly the attacker has they would likely end up netting more money overall. Currently on UniswapV3 these types of attacks are highly competitive which means a large amount of the profits wind up with the validators rather than the attacker. In this scenario the attacker would be the only person capable of conducting this attack (since they own the rTokens) allowing them to keep more the profit and not have to share as much with the validator.

## Impact

Snipping safeguards can be effectively bypassed

## Recommendation

Distribute fees proportionally to all in range liquidity. To prevent manipulation of in range liquidity, considering using the built in TWAP to determine which liquidity is eligible
