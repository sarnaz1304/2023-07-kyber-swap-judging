# Factory::updateConfigMaster() - Lack of input validation risks DoS of onlyConfigMaster() modifier and ability to set new ConfigMaster if parameter `_configMaster` is ever set to address(0), intentionally or accidentally.
## Summary

Lack of input validation risks DoS of onlyConfigMaster() modifier and ability to set new ConfigMaster if parameter `_configMaster` is ever set to address(0), intentionally or accidentally.

The other affected functions which all use the onlyConfigMaster() modifier:
enableWhitelist(), disableWhitelist(), addNFTManager(), removeNFTManager(), updateVestingPeriod(), enableSwapFee(), and updateFeeConfiguration().

## Vulnerability Detail

Lack of address(0) check for parameter `_configMaster`:

Onced state variable `configMaster` is set to address(0), it will not be possible to select a new ConfigMaster afterwards, because of the require check within the onlyConfigMaster() modifier, because msg.sender is impossible to ever be address(0), so the require check on L54 will permanently revert:

```Solidity
require(msg.sender == configMaster, 'forbidden');
```

Additionally, all the pool management functions which use this modifier, will revert too, for same reason as above.

## Impact

- DoS of the abovementioned functions and modifier, which would completely disable/DoS a large part of pool management, affecting one or more pools, which would likely require the redeployment of at least an updated/upgraded factory contract.
- Potentially large disruption to protocol's/pool operations
- It would remain possible to create new pools while not being able to manage them in terms of DoS'ed management functions.

## Recommendation

Add an input validation check to ensure function will revert accordingly:

```Solidity

  function updateConfigMaster(address _configMaster) external override onlyConfigMaster {
  + require(_configMaster != address(0), "Zero address not allowed.");
    emit ConfigMasterUpdated(configMaster, _configMaster);
    configMaster = _configMaster;
  }
  
```
