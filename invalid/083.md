# Users can receive fewer RTokens than intended due to an incorrect formula
## Summary
Users can receive fewer RTokens than intended due to an incorrect formula 

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies in the way the number of reinvestment tokens (rMintQty) is calculated in the code. The current formula used for this calculation is as follows:
`rMintQty = rTotalSupply * (reinvestL - reinvestLLast) / reinvestLLast * baseL / (baseL + reinvestL)`
However, this formula can lead to precision loss, resulting in users receiving a lower number of RTokens than they were expecting
Here is how formula above implemented in the codebase:
```solidity
19: uint256 lpContribution = FullMath.mulDivFloor(
20:       baseL,
21:       reinvestL - reinvestLLast,
22:       baseL + reinvestL
23: );
24: rMintQty = FullMath.mulDivFloor(rTotalSupply, lpContribution, reinvestLLast);
```
Precision loss occurs when the result of `baseL * (reinvestL - reinvestLLast)` divided by `(baseL + reinvestL)` is then multiplied by `rTotalSupply` and divided by `reinvestLLast`

## Impact
Users get less RTokens than intended

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change formula in a following way:
`(rTotalSupply * baseL * (reinvestL - reinvestLLast)) / (baseL + reinvestL) / reinvestLLast`
