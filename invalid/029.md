# Absence of Fee Transfer Verification in `_updatePosition` Function
## Summary
The `_updatePosition` function within the Pool contract calculates accumulated fees and aims to transfer them to liquidity providers. However, it lacks proper verification to confirm the success of the fee transfer. This absence of verification creates a risk that fees might be deducted from the pool but not successfully transferred to liquidity providers, leading to potential financial losses and inaccuracies.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_updatePosition` function performs the following key actions related to fee transfers:
1. `Fee Calculation` : The function calculates accumulated fees and fee growth within a specified tick range.
2. `Fee Transfer Attempt`:  If there are claimable fees, the function transfers these fees from the pool's balance to the liquidity provider's address using the `_transfer` function. Unfortunately, it does not include a mechanism to confirm whether the fee transfer was successful.
## Impact
If a fee transfer fails due to reasons such as out-of-gas errors or an invalid recipient address, fees might be deducted from the pool's balance without reaching the intended liquidity provider. As a result, liquidity providers could experience financial losses due to unreceived fees.

## Recommendation
After executing the fee transfer using the _transfer function, incorporate a validation step to verify whether the transfer was successful. This can be achieved by checking the return value of the _transfer function or by adopting a Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
