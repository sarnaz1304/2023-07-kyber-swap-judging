# The `owner` is a single point of failure and a centralization risk
## Summary
The `owner` is a single point of failure and a centralization risk

## Vulnerability Detail
Having a single EOA as the only owner of contracts is a large centralization risk and a single point of failure. A single private key may be taken in a hack, or the sole holder of the key may become unable to retrieve the key when necessary. 

## Impact
Drain all contract tokens

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: contracts/oracle/PoolOracle.sol

42:   function _authorizeUpgrade(address) internal override onlyOwner {}

45:   function rescueFund(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing to a multi-signature setup, or having a role-based authorization model.
