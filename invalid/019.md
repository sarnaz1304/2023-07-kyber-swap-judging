# Re-org attack
## Summary
Re-org attack
## Vulnerability Detail
Re-orgs can happen in all EVM chains. In ethereum, where currently Frankencoin is deployed, it is not “super common” but it still happens, being the last one less than a year ago: [ethereum-beacon-chain-blockchain-reorg](https://decrypt.co/101390/ethereum-beacon-chain-blockchain-reorg) The issue increases the changes of happening if deploying on L2’s/ rollups. where re-orgs have been much more active: [polygon-hit-by-157-block-reorg-despite-hard-fork-to-reduce-reorgs](https://protos.com/polygon-hit-by-157-block-reorg-despite-hard-fork-to-reduce-reorgs/) being the last one, less than a year ago.
