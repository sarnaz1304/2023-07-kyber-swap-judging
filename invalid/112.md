# `abi.encodePacked` Allows Hash collision
## Summary
From the solidity documentation:
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/abi-spec.html?highlight=collisions#non-standard-packed-mode
> If you use keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b)) and both a and b are dynamic types, it is easy to craft collisions in the hash value by moving parts of a into b and vice-versa. More specifically, abi.encodePacked("a", "bc") == abi.encodePacked("ab", "c").

This issue exists in the ERC721permit.sol contract can results in hash collisions, 
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
As the solidity docs describe, two or more dynamic types are passed to abi.encodePacked. Moreover, these dynamic values are user-specified function arguments in external functions, meaning anyone can directly specify the value of these arguments when calling the function.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of writing functions to accept several arguments that are hashed inside the function, consider rewriting the function to take the hashed value as a function argument directly so that the hashing process happens off-chain. This approach would solve the issue and save gas.
