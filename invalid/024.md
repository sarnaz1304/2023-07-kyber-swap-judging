# Anyone can become the owner of `PoolOracle.sol`
## Summary
Anyone can become the owner of `PoolOracle.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In `PoolOracle.sol`, `initialize()` function is used to initialize the `PoolOracle` contract which after the successful initialization gives the ownership of contract to any caller of `initialize()` function.

```Solidity
File: ks-elastic-sc/contracts/oracle/PoolOracle.sol

  function initialize() public initializer {
    __Ownable_init();
  }
```

The issue here is about the ownership of contract giving to the caller of function which happens due to ` __Ownable_init()`. ` __Ownable_init()` has been taken from `OwnableUpgradeable.sol` which is given as below,

```Solidity
File: v4.3.1/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol

    /**
     * @dev Initializes the contract setting the deployer as the initial owner.
     */
    function __Ownable_init() internal initializer {
        __Context_init_unchained();
        __Ownable_init_unchained();
    }

    function __Ownable_init_unchained() internal initializer {
        _setOwner(_msgSender());
    }
```

Another issue is once the attacker or any person gains the ownership of `PoolOracle.sol` contract then the following functions can not be accessed by Kyber-swap team,

```Solidity
File: ks-elastic-sc/contracts/oracle/PoolOracle.sol

  function rescueFund(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
```

This function is used to rescue funds from contract. Therefore any funds stuck in contract can be self transferred to the current owner of contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add access control on  `initialize()` and ensure only deployer of contract can access it, however such contracts should be deployed via factory contracts.
