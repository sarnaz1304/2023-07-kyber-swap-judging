# Eth can be stolen in position manager and Swap Router contracts
## Summary
Any ETH sent to the following contracts can be stolen via `refundEth` function:

* BasePositionManager
* AntiSnipAttackPositionManager
* KyberSwap V2 Swap Router

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/periphery/base/RouterTokenHelperWithFee.sol#L13

## Vulnerability Detail
The above contracts all inherit `RouterTokenHelper.sol` contract which gives anyone access to take eth from the contracts. 

These contracts currently only have one payable function that can receive ETH via `RouterTokenHelper.receive()`. This function requires the sender to be WETH. 

The risk for the manager contracts is lower because they don't interact with ETH, but the likelihood is higher for the swap router. 

For example, the WETH getting sent to the Swap Router via the swap function can be taken:
```solidity
function _swapExactInputInternal( ...
...
(int256 amount0, int256 amount1) = _getPool(tokenIn, tokenOut, fee).swap(
      recipient, // <-- recipient = Swap Router
      amountIn.toInt256(),
      isFromToken0,
      limitSqrtP == 0
        ? (isFromToken0 ? TickMath.MIN_SQRT_RATIO + 1 : TickMath.MAX_SQRT_RATIO - 1)
        : limitSqrtP,
      abi.encode(data)
    );
...
```
```solidity
// Pool.sol
function swap() {
...
// recipient = Swap Router
if (deltaQty0 < 0) token0.safeTransfer(recipient, deltaQty0.revToUint256());
...
}
```

## Impact
Users can potentially lose ETH if they unwrapped WETH and sent it to the manager contracts. Most importantly, any WETH sent to the Swap Router contract via `pool.swap` can be stolen. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
abstract contract RouterTokenHelper is IRouterTokenHelper, ImmutablePeripheryStorage {
  ...
  receive() external payable {
    require(msg.sender == WETH, 'Not WETH');
  }

  /// @dev Unwrap all ETH balance and send to the recipient
  function unwrapWeth(uint256 minAmount, address recipient) external payable override {
    uint256 balanceWETH = IWETH(WETH).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balanceWETH >= minAmount, 'Insufficient WETH');

    if (balanceWETH > 0) {
      IWETH(WETH).withdraw(balanceWETH);
      TokenHelper.transferEth(recipient, balanceWETH);
    }
  }
 ...

  /// @dev Send all ETH balance of this contract to the sender
  function refundEth() external payable override {
    if (address(this).balance > 0) TokenHelper.transferEth(msg.sender, address(this).balance);
  }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If ETH management logic is not necessary for the manager contracts, it's best to remove the following functions in `RouterTokenHelper.sol` or add access control:

*  `unwrapWeth`
* `receive`
* `refundEth()`
