# Inadequate Reinvestment Token Conversion in Pool Contract
## Summary
The `burnRTokens` allows liquidity providers to burn a certain amount of their reinvestment tokens and receive back a proportionate amount of liquidity from the pool. However, due to the reliance on fixed ratios and the assumption of constant liquidity dynamics, there's a potential issue where liquidity providers might receive an inadequate amount of liquidity in return for their burned reinvestment tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `burnRTokens` function in the Pool contract is designed to convert reinvestment tokens back into liquidity from the pool. The function calculates the amount of liquidity to be withdrawn (`deltaL`) by multiplying the amount of burned reinvestment tokens (`_qty`) with the ratio of reinvestment liquidity (`reinvestL`) to the total supply of reinvestment tokens (`totalSupply()`). Subsequently, the function calculates `qty0` and `qty1`, representing the expected amounts of `token0` and `token1` that should be received in exchange for the burned reinvestment tokens.
<br/>
However, this approach assumes that the proportion between reinvestment liquidity and total reinvestment tokens remains constant, which might not hold true in a dynamic liquidity environment. If the liquidity dynamics of the pool have changed significantly since the reinvestment tokens were minted, the calculated `qty0` and `qty1` values might not accurately represent the actual liquidity available in the pool.
## Impact
Liquidity providers could potentially burn reinvestment tokens and receive back an inadequately proportionate amount of liquidity from the pool. This mismatch between expected and actual liquidity received could lead to financial losses for liquidity providers.

## Recommendation
Regularly update and synchronize the pool's state and liquidity dynamics to ensure accurate calculations during the conversion process.
