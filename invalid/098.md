# Signature Malleability
## Summary
`ecrecover()` is vulnerable to signature malleability, so it can be dangerous to use it directly

## Vulnerability Detail
The elliptic curve used in Ethereum for signatures is symmetrical, hence for every [v,r,s] there exists another [v,r,s] that returns the same valid result. Therefore [two valid signatures exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3TJLDHZBFU) which allows attackers to compute a valid signature without knowing the signer's private key. ecrecover() is vulnerable to signature malleability [[1](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-117), [2](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-121)] so it can be dangerous to use it directly. 
An attacker can compute another corresponding [v,r,s] that will make this check pass due to the symmetrical nature of the elliptic curve. The easiest way to prevent this issue is to use OpenZeppelin’s [ECDSA.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol) library and reading the comments above ECDSA's tryRecover() function provides very useful information on correctly implementing signature checks to prevent signature malleability vulnerabilities.
When using OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library, special care must be taken to [use version 4.7.3 or greater](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-kairos-judging/issues/151), since previous versions contained a signature malleability bug

```solidity
 if (Address.isContract(owner)) {
      require(
        IERC1271(owner).isValidSignature(digest, abi.encodePacked(r, s, v)) == 0x1626ba7e,
        'Unauthorized'
      );
    } else {
      address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);
      require(recoveredAddress != address(0), 'Invalid signature');
      require(recoveredAddress == owner, 'Unauthorized');
    }
```
## Impact
Bypass the signature verification check
