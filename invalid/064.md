# Swaps that do not cross initialized ticks incur no fees
## Summary

Swap fees are only paid out when a swap crosses an initialized tick. The protocol's documentation gives an example of a swap not crossing a tick and still applying fees, leading me to believe that fees are intended to be collected even when not crossing an initialized tick: https://docs.kyberswap.com/liquidity-solutions/kyberswap-elastic/concepts/anti-sniping-mechanism#swapping-exact-input-of-token0-amount-not-enough-to-cross-tick

## Vulnerability Detail

The swap function loops while the specified input/output amount is not reached or the price limit is not reached. In each loop iteration, the swap function calculates the amount required to reach the next initialized tick (or `C.MAX_TICK_DISTANCE` at most) and proceeds the swap until reaching that tick. If the swap completes within that tick, the loop breaks and fee calculation that occurs later in the loop iteration does not apply. The loop continues if the next tick is reached via `C.MAX_TICK_DISTANCE` and not an initialized tick, also avoiding fees.

As a result, fees are only ever applied when a swap results in a price movement that crosses an initialized tick (a tick set as a min or max price limit for a liquidity provider):

```solidity
  function swap(
    address recipient,
    int256 swapQty,
    bool isToken0,
    uint160 limitSqrtP,
    bytes calldata data
  ) external override lock returns (int256 deltaQty0, int256 deltaQty1) {
    ...
    // continue swapping while specified input/output isn't satisfied or price limit not reached
    while (swapData.specifiedAmount != 0 && swapData.sqrtP != limitSqrtP) {
     ...
      int24 tempNextTick = swapData.nextTick;
      if (willUpTick && tempNextTick > C.MAX_TICK_DISTANCE + swapData.currentTick) {
        tempNextTick = swapData.currentTick + C.MAX_TICK_DISTANCE;
      } else if (!willUpTick && tempNextTick < swapData.currentTick - C.MAX_TICK_DISTANCE) {
        tempNextTick = swapData.currentTick - C.MAX_TICK_DISTANCE;
      }

      ...

      // if price has not reached the next sqrt price
      if (swapData.sqrtP != swapData.nextSqrtP) {
        if (swapData.sqrtP != swapData.startSqrtP) {
          // update the current tick data in case the sqrtP has changed
          swapData.currentTick = TickMath.getTickAtSqrtRatio(swapData.sqrtP);
        }
        break;  // @audit break without applying fees
      }
      swapData.currentTick = willUpTick ? tempNextTick : tempNextTick - 1;
      // if tempNextTick is not next initialized tick
      if (tempNextTick != swapData.nextTick) continue;  // @audit continue without applying fees

      if (cache.rTotalSupply == 0) {
        // load variables that are only initialized when crossing a tick
        cache.rTotalSupply = totalSupply();
        cache.reinvestLLast = poolData.reinvestLLast;
        cache.feeGrowthGlobal = poolData.feeGrowthGlobal;
        cache.secondsPerLiquidityGlobal = _syncSecondsPerLiquidity(
          poolData.secondsPerLiquidityGlobal,
          swapData.baseL
        );
        (cache.feeTo, cache.governmentFeeUnits) = factory.feeConfiguration();
      }
      // update rTotalSupply, feeGrowthGlobal and reinvestL
      uint256 rMintQty = ReinvestmentMath.calcrMintQty(
        swapData.reinvestL,
        cache.reinvestLLast,
        swapData.baseL,
        cache.rTotalSupply
      );
      if (rMintQty != 0) {
        cache.rTotalSupply += rMintQty;
        // overflow/underflow not possible bc governmentFeeUnits < 20000
        unchecked {
          uint256 governmentFee = (rMintQty * cache.governmentFeeUnits) / C.FEE_UNITS;
          cache.governmentFee += governmentFee;

          uint256 lpFee = rMintQty - governmentFee;
          cache.lpFee += lpFee;

          cache.feeGrowthGlobal += FullMath.mulDivFloor(lpFee, C.TWO_POW_96, swapData.baseL);
        }
      }
      cache.reinvestLLast = swapData.reinvestL;

      (swapData.baseL, swapData.nextTick) = _updateLiquidityAndCrossTick(
        swapData.nextTick,
        swapData.baseL,
        cache.feeGrowthGlobal,
        cache.secondsPerLiquidityGlobal,
        willUpTick
      );
    }

    // if the swap crosses at least 1 initalized tick
    if (cache.rTotalSupply != 0) {
      if (cache.governmentFee > 0) _mint(cache.feeTo, cache.governmentFee);
      if (cache.lpFee > 0) _mint(address(this), cache.lpFee);
      poolData.reinvestLLast = cache.reinvestLLast;
      poolData.feeGrowthGlobal = cache.feeGrowthGlobal;
    }
    ...
    }
```

## Impact

Fees will not be collected for liquidity providers when swaps are not crossing an initialized tick. 

Additionally, smart users can segment their swaps that are supposed to cross a tick in multiple swaps stopping/starting right before a tick to avoid paying fees. Due to the nature of the algorithm (looping on liquidity in between each initialized tick), fragmenting a swap will not be much more gas expensive (the swap is already logically fragmented) if done within the same transaction.

Since the fees incurred are proportional to the swapped amount, users can also decide to cross initialized ticks with very little swap amounts and swap larger amounts in between initialized ticks.

I believe this will result in a very reduced yield for liquidity providers (loss of funds for the LP). They will be disincentivized to participate in the protocol due to the lower than anticipated yield and protocol may struggle with liquidity.

The fragmenting of swap amount to cross ticks with as little swap amounts can be automated by a smart contract. The attacker smart contract can read the tick state from the pool to swap big amounts in between initialized ticks and tiny amounts across initialized ticks. That is, an attacker router can be built on top of Kyberswap to render LP fees negligible.

## Recommendation

Apply the fees before breaking / continuing in the swap loop.
