# Using revert() along with a custom error will save gas
## Summary
The ```
rescueFund()```
 function inside ```
PoolOracle.sol```
would consume lot of gas even if token address is the zero address
## Vulnerability Detail
To allow the rescue of funds stuck in the contracts the ```
rescueFund()```
function takes in two parameters: ```
token```
an address and ```
amount```
an uint256 ,  and perform a call operation to send zero address funds to the owner address. This is not necessary.
## Impact
a call to owner address would consume gas to send zero address token to owner. This gas consumptioncan be avoided by simply reverting the tx along with a custom error message that uses way less gas . 
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/oracle/PoolOracle.sol#L45-L48
```solidity
 function rescueFund(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    if (token == address(0)) {
      (bool success, ) = payable(owner()).call{value: amount}('');
      require(success, "failed to collect native");
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use 
```revert() + customError()``` 
to revert the tx if token address is zero address . eg: 
```solidity
function rescueFund(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    if (token == address(0)) {
      revert() AddressIsZeroAddress()
```
