# Some minor issues & recommendations
## Summary

- QA: using `if statements` along with custom errors, instead of require statements, is better overall.
- QA: Factory::removeNFTManager() - L139: incorrect/misleading comment.
- QA: Factory::enableSwapFee() - L153: function visibility modifier: unless going to be called internally, which doesn't seem to be the case, suggest to change to `external`.
- LOW: Factory::enableSwapFee() - L160: I suspect that < should actually be <= .

## Vulnerability Detail

1. QA: Factory::removeNFTManager() - L139: incorrect/misleading comment.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Factory.sol#L139

Existing comment:
"Returns true if removal was successful, that is if it was not already present"

Recommendation:
Corrected comment:
"Returns true if removal was successful, that is if it was already present"


2. QA: Factory::enableSwapFee() - L153: function visibility modifier: unless going to be called internally, which doesn't seem to be the case, suggest to change to `external`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Factory.sol#L153


3. LOW: Factory::enableSwapFee() - L160: I suspect that < should actually be <= .

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Factory.sol#L158-L160

From below comment I suspect/assume that the max acceptable value for tick distance is actually 16384, which leads me to conclude that using < is wrong:

```Solidity
    // tick distance is capped at 16384 to prevent the situation where tickDistance is so large that
    // 16384 ticks represents a >5x price change with ticks of 1 bips
    require(tickDistance > 0 && tickDistance < 16384, 'invalid tickDistance');
```

Recommendation:

```Solidity
require(tickDistance > 0 && tickDistance <= 16384, 'invalid tickDistance');
```

## Impact
