# Initial Pool Creator Does Not Receive LP Tokens or NFT Position, Losing Initial Liquidity
## Summary

The initial pool creator in the KyberSwap protocol does not receive LP tokens or an NFT position in return for their initial liquidity. This essentially makes their tokens "trapped" within the contract with no way to claim them back.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `BasePositionManager.sol#createAndUnlockPoolIfNecessary` Function we can create a pool and unlock it by sending it necessary token regarding currentSqrtP we choose :
```solidity
//E fetch pool address, create if necessary and set the price to currentSqrtP by sending it needed tokens
  function createAndUnlockPoolIfNecessary(
    address token0,
    address token1,
    uint24 fee,
    uint160 currentSqrtP //E current sqrt Price
  ) external payable override returns (address pool) {
    require(token0 < token1);
    pool = IFactory(factory).getPool(token0, token1, fee);
    if (pool == address(0)) {
      pool = IFactory(factory).createPool(token0, token1, fee);
    }
    (uint160 sqrtP, , , ) = IPool(pool).getPoolState();
    if (sqrtP == 0) {
      //E return q0 = 100 * 2**96 / initialSqrtP and q1 = 100 * initialSqrtP / 2**96
      //E returns number of tokens needed in the pool to have currentSqrtPrice
      (uint256 qty0, uint256 qty1) = QtyDeltaMath.calcUnlockQtys(currentSqrtP);
      //E transfer these tokens needed from msg.sender to pool
      _transferTokens(token0, msg.sender, pool, qty0);
      _transferTokens(token1, msg.sender, pool, qty1);
      //E Sets the initial price for the pool and seeds reinvestment liquidity
      IPool(pool).unlockPool(currentSqrtP);
      ....
    }
  }
```

These lines transfer the required tokens from the `msg.sender` to the newly created pool. However, the `msg.sender` doesn't receive any LP tokens or an NFT position in return : 

In `Pool.sol#unlockPool()` Function:
```solidity
//E liquidity minted to the pool directly 
_mint(address(this), C.MIN_LIQUIDITY);
```
Liquidity is minted directly to address(this) which is the pool contract itself. There is no mechanism for the initial liquidity provider to claim these.

However when a classic user add liquidity and create a position in the pool , an ERC721 token is minted for the user as you can see in `BasePositionManager.sol#mint()` function  :
```solidity
_mint(params.recipient, tokenId);
```
Subsequent liquidity providers receive an ERC-721 NFT position, unlike the initial creator, marking a discrepancy.

## Impact

**Financial Loss**: The initial liquidity provider loses the tokens they have used to create the pool, without any ability to reclaim them.
**Fairness**: This could discourage users from creating new pools, as they donâ€™t get LP tokens or ownership NFTs, unlike subsequent liquidity providers.

## Recommendation

Mint LP Tokens or NFT to initial pool creator as it is done when using mint() from BasePositionManager.sol or AntiSnipAttackPositionManager.sol
