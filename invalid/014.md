# Missing access control Oracle initialization function parameter
## Summary
the ```initializeOracle()``` function in poolOracle.sol accepts an arbitrary time parameter which is supposed to be block.timestamp truncated to uint32. The issue is the function access control which allows anyone to initialize oracle with any time they want.
## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can call ```initializeOracle()``` with an arbitrary time which can be in the past or in the future, manipulating the observation data, since we have no garantee the time parameter will be related to block.timestamp
## Impact
Observation timestamp manipulation

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
remove the time parameter if it's no use or checks for valide time parameters
