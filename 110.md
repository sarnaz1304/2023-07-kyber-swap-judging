# Factory::enableSwapFee() - L152: no zero amount check for `swapFeeUnits`.
## Summary

Factory::enableSwapFee() - L152: no zero amount check for `swapFeeUnits`.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Factory.sol#L152-L164

Currently it is totally possible to assign zero value to `swapFeeUnits` successfully via the enableSwapFee() functions. It will pass the require checks.
Unless it is intended functionality(which I doubt), meaning that it should be possible/acceptable to set `swapFeeUnits = 0`, there should be a check to ensure zero value cannot be assigned to `swapFeeUnits`.

## Impact
At least no swap fees, possibly impacting other areas of protocol.

## Tool used
VSC.
Manual Review

## Recommendation

There should be a check to ensure zero value cannot be assigned to `swapFeeUnits`:
Add the following above L157:
```solidity
require(swapFeeUnits != 0, 'zero units');
```
