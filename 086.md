# Inappropriate Check Can Lead to Premature Adjustments In Liquidity
## Summary

There is a potential issue in the logic that determines whether the current tick is outside the specified position range. The conditional check for the upper boundary of the tick range mistakenly considers the boundary itself as outside the range.


## Vulnerability Detail

In the provided code, the condition to check if the `currentTick` is above the position's range is:

if (currentTick >= posData.tickUpper) {
    ...
}

Unfortunately, this also implies that when the `currentTick` is exactly equal to `posData.tickUpper`, the logic treats it as if it's outside the position range.

## Impact

This could lead to premature adjustments to liquidity. Users might be prompted to provide more of token1 even when the price (represented by currentTick) is still within their specified range, which could lead to the users missing out on fees to be earned due to their liquidity which is still in range.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the condition from ">= " to " > ". This will ensure that the logic inside the condition only executes when the current price truly exceeds the upper boundary of the position's range.
