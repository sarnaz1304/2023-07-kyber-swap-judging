# Vulnerability in refundEth and unwrapWeth Functions
## Summary
The refundEth and unwrapWeth functions, inherited from RouterTokenHelper and present in the BasePositionManager and LiquidityHelper contracts, are susceptible to frontrunning attacks due to their non-atomic nature.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract design allows for a sequence of operations involving transferring WETH, unwrapping it, and then adding liquidity. This multi-transactional pattern is not atomic, meaning that it doesn't guarantee that a series of operations will complete without any interference or interruption.

Given this, an attacker can take advantage of the non-atomic nature of the process by observing a pending transaction that is about to transfer WETH or add liquidity, and then frontrun it with their own transaction that calls refundEth or unwrapWeth. By doing this, the attacker can effectively siphon off the ETH or WETH meant for the original transaction.

## Impact
Frontrunning Exploits: Malicious actors can monitor the transaction pool for pending transactions targeting the vulnerable contract functions and then exploit them to their advantage, potentially leading to financial losses for the user.

Unexpected Behaviors: Due to the potential for frontrunning, users might experience unexpected transaction outcomes, which can erode trust in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement an Atomic Function: Design and implement a function that handles the entire process of transferring, unwrapping, and adding liquidity in a single transaction. This will ensure that the process is atomic, preventing any potential frontrunning attacks.

For the refundEth and unwrapWeth functions, override them in the BasePositionManager to introduce necessary access controls. 
```solidity
modifier onlyAuthorized() {
        require(msg.sender == owner /* or other authorization logic */, "Not authorized");
        _;
    }
    // Override the refundEth and unwrapWeth functions to add access control
    function refundEth() external payable override onlyAuthorized {
        super.refundEth();
    }

    function unwrapWeth(uint256 minAmount, address recipient) external payable override onlyAuthorized {
        super.unwrapWeth(minAmount, recipient);
    }
}

```
