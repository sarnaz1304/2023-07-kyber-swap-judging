# `unchecked` vulnerability
## Summary
The contract contains instances where the `unchecked` keyword is used in calculations involving external calls. This practice can be risky if not handled carefully, as it might lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if not properly validated or handled.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the use of the `unchecked` keyword when performing calculations involving external calls. In Solidity, the `unchecked` keyword is used to suppress overflow and underflow checks for certain operations. While this can sometimes lead to gas savings, it also requires careful validation to ensure that the operations are safe and won't lead to unintended consequences.

## Impact
The unchecked external calls vulnerability could lead to incorrect results or even unexpected behavior in various scenarios. For instance, if the calculations involving unchecked external calls are used in price computations or liquidity calculations, the contract's internal state could become inconsistent, leading to incorrect trading behavior or mismanagement of liquidity. In the worst case, this vulnerability could potentially be exploited by attackers to manipulate contract behavior or steal assets.

## Code Snippet
Here is an example of the code snippet where unchecked external calls are used:

```solidity
unchecked {
  uint256 rMintQty = (rMintQty * governmentFeeUnits) / C.FEE_UNITS;
  if (rGovtQty != 0) {
    _mint(feeTo, rGovtQty);
  }
  return rMintQty - rGovtQty;
}
```

In this example, the unchecked external call is used to calculate a government fee deduction. If `governmentFeeUnits` is not properly validated or if the calculations are incorrect, it could lead to unexpected results or even loss of funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to avoid using the `unchecked` keyword in calculations involving external calls, especially when handling financial calculations or contract state updates. Instead, perform proper input validation, handle exceptions, and ensure that operations adhere to safe mathematical practices. Whenever external calls are involved, it's important to handle the potential risks carefully and ensure that the calculations are accurate and secure.
