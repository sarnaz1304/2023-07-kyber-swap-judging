# The admin can set a swap fee of more than 20%
## Summary

The admin can set a swap fee of more than 20% and this is forbidden according to the documentation.

> #### Is the admin/owner of the protocol/contracts TRUSTED or RESTRICTED?
> - Restricted - Owner shouldn’t be able to steal funds, but is trusted with setting fee recipient address and fee collection (up to 20%)
## Vulnerability Detail

In `Factory.sol` we have `enableSwapFee()` function:

```solidity
function enableSwapFee(uint24 swapFeeUnits, int24 tickDistance)
    public
    override
    onlyConfigMaster
  {
    require(swapFeeUnits < MathConstants.FEE_UNITS, 'invalid fee');
    // tick distance is capped at 16384 to prevent the situation where tickDistance is so large that
    // 16384 ticks represents a >5x price change with ticks of 1 bips
    require(tickDistance > 0 && tickDistance < 16384, 'invalid tickDistance');
    require(feeAmountTickDistance[swapFeeUnits] == 0, 'existing tickDistance');
    feeAmountTickDistance[swapFeeUnits] = tickDistance;
    emit SwapFeeEnabled(swapFeeUnits, tickDistance);
  }
```

This function allows `onlyConfigMaster` to set a swap fee and a tick distance. 
According to the readme, admin functions are RESTRICTED about theft of funds or the settlement of fees of more than 20%. 
In this case, the restriction we have is:
```solidity
require(swapFeeUnits < MathConstants.FEE_UNITS, 'invalid fee');
```
`MathConstants.FEE_UNITS` is `FEE_UNITS = 100000`. This means the fee can be up to 100% and the admin can set a value greater than 20% and harm the users.
## Impact

The admin can set a swap fee of more than 20% and hurt users which is forbidden according to the readme

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To impose the 20% limit, the require statement should be changed to:
```solidity
require(swapFeeUnits <= 20000, 'invalid fee');
```
