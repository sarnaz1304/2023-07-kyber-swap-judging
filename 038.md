# Lack of Slippage Protection in swap Function
## Summary
The `swap` function in the provided code lacks slippage protection, which can lead to differences between the expected price of an asset and the actual executed price during token swaps.
## Vulnerability Detail
The swap function is designed to facilitate swaps within a liquidity pool while enforcing price limits (limitSqrtP). However, the lack of explicit slippage protection can result in price slippage. Here's how the vulnerability relates to the code and its purpose:
```solidity
// verify limitSqrtP
if (willUpTick) {
  require(
    limitSqrtP > swapData.sqrtP && limitSqrtP < TickMath.MAX_SQRT_RATIO,
    'bad limitSqrtP'
  );
} else {
  require(
    limitSqrtP < swapData.sqrtP && limitSqrtP > TickMath.MIN_SQRT_RATIO,
    'bad limitSqrtP'
  );
}
```
- The code verifies the price limits (`limitSqrtP`) at the beginning of the function based on the current square root price (`swapData.sqrtP`).
- The function then enters a loop to perform swaps and liquidity adjustments based on calculations made at the start of each loop iteration.
- During the loop, the price can change significantly, potentially leading to slippage between the verified price and the executed price.
## Impact
Users may experience price slippage when executing swaps, resulting in a difference between the expected and actual executed prices. This can lead to suboptimal trade outcomes for users, especially in volatile markets or low-liquidity scenarios.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Users should be provided with an estimate of the expected price and an option to specify their acceptable slippage tolerance. If the expected slippage exceeds the user's tolerance, a warning can be displayed, allowing users to adjust their trade parameters or confirm the transaction accordingly. This approach empowers users to make informed decisions and manage slippage based on their preferences.
