# Critical Access Control Vulnerability in Pool.sol's 'burn' Function
## Summary
The burn function in the Pool.sol contract lacks proper access control, allowing any user, including attackers, to call the function and potentially burn all tokens in the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
Lack of Access Control: The burn function does not have any access control checks, which means it can be called by any Ethereum address without any restrictions.

Owner Check: The code checks whether the caller (msg.sender) is the owner of the token identified by tokenId. However, this check alone is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access because it only ensures that the caller is the owner of the token being burned.

Missing Whitelist or Permission Check: To properly secure the burn function, it should either:
a. Use a whitelist mechanism to allow only specific addresses (e.g., trusted contracts or managers) to call the burn function, which is not present in the provided code.
b. Include additional checks to ensure that the caller has the necessary permissions, such as checking if they are an approved manager or controller for this contract.
## Impact
The lack of access control means that unauthorized users can take control of this function and potentially destroy all tokens in the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Whitelist specific addresses that are allowed to call the burn function using a function like factory.isWhitelistedNFTManager(msg.sender). Ensure that only whitelisted addresses can access this function.
OR
Check if the caller is the approved owner of the token using require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, tokenId), "Not approved or owner"). This ensures that only the owner or an approved address for a specific token can call the burn function.
