# deploy() will not work on zkSync with current implementation
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

Per the contest page, Kyber-swap protocol is intended to deployed on below chains

> Mainnet, BNB Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Fantom, Linea, Polygon zkEVM, Base, BitTorrent, Cronos, Velas, Oasis (and could be any EVM compatible chains)

As stated in contest Read, `(and could be any EVM compatible chains)` We are discussing an issue with zksync era with regards to implementation of `deploy()` in `CodeDeployer.sol`. Which can be seen below(_comments not shown below due to simplicity_)

```Solidity
File: ks-elastic-sc/contracts/libraries/CodeDeployer.sol

>>  function deploy(bytes memory code) internal returns (address destination) {
    bytes32 deployerCreationCode = _DEPLOYER_CREATION_CODE;

    assembly {
      let codeLength := mload(code)

      mstore(code, deployerCreationCode)

>>      destination := create(0, code, add(codeLength, 32))

      mstore(code, codeLength)
    }

    assert(destination != address(0));
  }
```
According to ZKSync Era's documentation, the bytecode of a contract must be known beforehand by the compiler for the CREATE/CREATE2 opcode to work:

> To guarantee that create/create2 functions operate correctly, the compiler must be aware of the bytecode of the deployed contract in advance. The compiler interprets the calldata arguments as incomplete input for ContractDeployer, as the remaining part is filled in by the compiler internally.

However, in deploy() fucnction of CodeDeployer.sol contract, the contract's bytecode is provided by the caller as an argument. It can be seen the bytes code,

```Solidity
  function deploy(bytes memory code) internal returns (address destination) {
```
is directly passed in `create()`

```Solidity
      destination := create(0, code, add(codeLength, 32))
```

Therefore, `deploy()` function will not work on ZKSync due to the following official reason by zkSync.

It is to be noted here that `deploy()` has been used in `BaseSplitCodeFactory.sol` constructor [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/libraries/BaseSplitCodeFactory.sol#L74). Therefore the issue must be fixed.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refer the zkSync [documentation](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/architecture/differences-with-ethereum.html#create-create2) to take the create() design consideration for zkSync as explained above.
