# Swapping can be sandwiched
## Summary
The `swap()` is a function designed for swapping between two tokens (token0 -> token1, or vice versa).

## Vulnerability Detail
The `swap()` is a function designed for swapping between two tokens (token0 -> token1, or vice versa).
While the function sets something like slippage protection via `limitSqrtP` parameter where, the user can specify a price limit that the swap can reach. The minimum and maximum price limits a user can specify is MIN_SQRT_RATIO + 1 and MAX_SQRT_RATIO - 1.

```solidity
    if (willUpTick) {
      require(
        limitSqrtP > swapData.sqrtP && limitSqrtP < TickMath.MAX_SQRT_RATIO,
        'bad limitSqrtP'
      );
    } else {
      require(
        limitSqrtP < swapData.sqrtP && limitSqrtP > TickMath.MIN_SQRT_RATIO,
        'bad limitSqrtP'
      );
    }
```

However the price of `sqrtPrice` is only determined during the transaction. opening sandwich opportunity for MEV researchers as long as the slippage stays below `limitSqrtP`.

### Let's consider the following attack scenario:
*Note: for the calculations I will use the [amm-calculator.vercel.app](https://amm-calculator.vercel.app/)*

**Initial Pool State**:
1. **Pool**: We'll start with a pool that contains 10,000 stETH and 10,695 WETH.
2. **User's Intention**: A user intends to stake 100 stETH.
3. **Attacker's Tools**: The attacker has ample liquidity (can get and flash loan) and monitors pending transactions, aiming to exploit large trades.

### Attack Sequence:

**Transaction 1 (TX1): Attacker's Initial Move**
- Before the user's `swap` transaction goes through, the attacker sees it pending in the transaction pool.
- The attacker swaps 100 WETH for WETH. Given our initial pool balance, they would receive roughly 92.63 stETH.
- After this trade, the pool balance is: 9907.37 stETH and 10,795 WETH.

**Transaction 2 (TX2): User's Swap**
- The user goes ahead with their swap. Given the manipulated pool balance, the exchange rate for WETH to stETH has shifted unfavorably for the user.
- Using the contract's logic, let's say that the minimum WETH the user expects for their 33.3333 WETH is 30.284 stETH.
- The user's `swap` transaction goes through, and the user ends up receiving slightly more than the minimum due to the pool's mechanics, say 30.498 stETH (still much less than they would have gotten without the attacker's interference).
- After this trade, the pool balance is: 9876.86 stETH and 10,828.33 WETH.


**Transaction 3 (TX3): Attacker's Reversal**
- The attacker now sells back their 92.63 stETH for WETH.
- Given the new pool balance, the attacker would receive roughly 100.61 WETH for their 92.63 stETH.
- After this trade, the pool has around 9969.49 stETH and 10,727.72 WETH.

### Outcome:
1. **Attacker's Profit**: The attacker started with 100 WETH and now has 100.61 WETH, netting a profit of 0.61 WETH.
2. **User's Loss**: The user swapped 10 WETH but got a worse rate (7.9 stETH instead of a potentially better rate) because of the attacker's manipulation.

So, the user's action in the "sandwiched" transaction (TX2) is about the attacker manipulating the price in an AMM pool right before a large user trade, causing the user to get a less favorable rate, then the attacker trades back after the user's transaction, reverting the price and profiting from the artificially created price difference.

## Impact
A user can gain significant profit multiple times by executing a sandwiching attack.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider to determine `sqrtPrice` using the TWAP price.
