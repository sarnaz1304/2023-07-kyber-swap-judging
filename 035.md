# Inconsistent Liquidity Range Calculation in mint Function
## Summary
The `mint` function in the provided Pool contract calculates liquidity adjustments based on the provided `ticksPrevious` array. However, due to potential inconsistencies between the actual tick values and the `ticksPrevious` array at the time of execution, there is a risk that liquidity might be added to the wrong tick range. This can lead to unintended exposure to price movements and potential financial losses for liquidity providers.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `mint` function in the Pool contract calculates liquidity adjustments for adding liquidity based on the `ticksPrevious` array provided by the caller. The function then proceeds to mint reinvestment tokens (`KS2-RT`) and provide liquidity based on the calculated adjustments. However, there is a possibility of inconsistency between the tick values reflected in the `ticksPrevious` array and the actual tick values of the pool at the time of execution. This inconsistency can be exploited by attackers or simply lead to unintended results.

Possible Attack Scenario:
1. Initial Conditions:
- The liquidity provider intends to add liquidity within a specific tick range defined by tickLower and tickUpper.
- The attacker is monitoring pending transactions on the blockchain and identifies a pending mint transaction from the liquidity provider.
2. Observing Pending Transaction:
- The attacker observes the liquidity provider's pending mint transaction and the associated ticksPrevious array, which indicates the intended tick range for liquidity addition.
3. Calculating Manipulation:
- The attacker calculates the required changes to the tick values (tickLower and tickUpper) that would be beneficial to them, considering potential price movements.
4. Submitting Exploitative Transaction:
- The attacker quickly submits their own mint transaction with manipulated tickLower and tickUpper values that move the tick range in their favor.
- This could involve adjusting the tick range in a way that results in the pool offering more favorable terms, such as increasing the range where one token appreciates more against the other.
5. Transaction Ordering:
- If the attacker's transaction gets mined before the liquidity provider's transaction, the liquidity range is manipulated in the attacker's favor.
- The function calculates liquidity adjustments based on the manipulated tick values, which might lead to more favorable outcomes for the attacker.
6. Benefit and Attack Success:
- The manipulated liquidity range leads to more advantageous terms for the attacker's liquidity addition. For instance, they might end up providing less of a token that appreciates more, maximizing their potential gains.
7. Liquidity Provider's Transaction:
- The liquidity provider's original transaction gets executed, but the liquidity range has already been manipulated by the attacker's transaction.
## Impact
If liquidity is added in the wrong tick range due to inconsistencies, liquidity providers might end up with an unintended exposure to price movements. This exposure could lead to unexpected financial losses if price movements are not aligned with the provider's intentions.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract should validate the current tick values in real time rather than solely relying on the `ticksPrevious` array. This would prevent attackers from exploiting the inconsistency between the tick values and ensure that liquidity adjustments are based on accurate and up-to-date information. Additionally, the use of atomic operations or reentrancy protection mechanisms can reduce the risk of transaction ordering manipulation by attackers.
