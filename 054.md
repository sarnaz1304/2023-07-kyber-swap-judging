# Exact-output trades do not work in pools with fees of 0
## Summary

Pools with 0 swap fees are perfectly legal. However, in such pools, most exact-output swaps revert due to a division by 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

Specifically, the culprit is https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/libraries/SwapMath.sol#L214 . This computes the quadratic formula with a=swapFees. If swapFees is 0, this is a division by 0. 

This code is hit on all exact-output trades where the desired output is actually received.

## Impact

Fee-0 pools partially nonfunctional.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Testing on Remix + manual review

## Recommendation

Add a case to this code to check for 0 swapFees.
