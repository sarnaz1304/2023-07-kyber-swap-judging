# PositionManager can be used to trade RTokens from other pools, until they can't.
## Summary

BasePositionManager can be used to trade RTokens for other pools, the same way that Uniswap LP tokens are traded. This works perfectly fine, and there is nothing in the docs suggesting people not do this. Except that anyone can run an off switch that makes this break.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Alice is an LP on KyberSwap Pool 1, either directly (if the whitelist is disabled) or through PositionManager 1
2. Eve sets up a new pool for Pool 1's RTokens using PositionManager 2 and convinces Alice to swap her Pool 1 RTokens on it
3. People trade for a while, and everything is happy. Alice is able to add and remove from her position, and withdraw her RTokens. This is because PositionManager 2 does not yet know that these tokens being swapped are RTokens.
4. Eve then calls mint() on PositionManager 2, creating a position on Pool 1. This sets `isRToken[pool1]` to true.
5. Alice can never withdraw her RTokens from PositionManager 2.

This means that KyberSwap can be used to dupe someone into losing their tokens.  It can also happen innocently if someone wants to trade their RTokens the way that LP tokens are traded.

## Impact

Some perfectly valid pools can get shut down mid-trading

## Code Snippet

Cannot transfer out tokens for which `isRToken` is set: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/periphery/BasePositionManager.sol#L298

isRToken does not get set until someone sets a position in that pool: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/periphery/BasePositionManager.sol#L362

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Transfer withdrawn tokens to users directly. Do not rely on them calling transferAllTokens.
