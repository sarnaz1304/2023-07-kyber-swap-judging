# An attacker can easily compromise the entire `burnRTokens()` function.
## Summary
`burnRTokens()` function burns reinvestment tokens in exchange to receive the fees collected in token0 and token1.

If the `isLogicalBurn` is set to false, the real burn in function is done by the following steps:
- Pool fetches data about the pool's current state.
- Pool calls `_syncFeeGrowth()` to update fee growth data.
- Pool calculates a `deltaL` which is a portion of the total reinvested liquidity that corresponds to the `_qty` of rTokens being burned.
- Pool updates the `reinvestL` value of the pool by subtracting the `deltaL`.
- Pool calculates the actual quantities `qty0` and `qty1` of underlying tokens that should be sent back to the user for the burned rTokens.
- Pool burns the specified `_qty` of rTokens.
- Pool sends the calculated `qty0` and `qty1` amounts of the underlying tokens to the user.

However the calculation of `deltaL` can be manipulated via several ways. ([L279](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L279))

```solidity
    uint256 deltaL = FullMath.mulDivFloor(_qty, reinvestL, totalSupply());
```

## Vulnerability Detail
*Note: The `whitelistedNFTManagers` address set is rendered meaningless since the whitelist can be turned off from the `Factory`.*

I will explain one method by which an attacker can disrupt the protocol workflow and profit by manipulating `deltaL`.

**By depositing and withdrawing a specific amount of `R tokens` each time.**

Suppose the pool state is as follows: 100 reinvestL; 100 totalSupply; 100 minted R tokens in the pool.

1. A user obtains a flash loan to execute all calls within a single transaction. Although the user incurs no losses, this action effectively harms other users/liquidity providers.
2. The attacker's objective is to reduce the `deltaL` to zero. They calculate the number of calls required to achieve this and then execute their malicious function.
3. They deposit a specific amount of tokens using the `mint` function. (With the initial deposit, he mint 100 R tokens.)
4. They immediately invoke the `burnRTokens` function. Inside `burnRTokens()`, `deltaL` is computed as: `(user quantity * reinvestL) / total supply of the reinvestment token` -> deltaL = (100 * 100) / 200 = 50; reinvestL = 100 - 50 = 50.
5. Subsequently, the attacker mints 50 R tokens and immediately calls the `burnRTokens()` function. This process is repeated multiple times:
   - deltaL = (100 * 50) / 200 = 25; reinvestL = 50 - 25 = 25.
   - deltaL = (100 * 25) / 200 = 12; reinvestL = 25 - 12 = 13.
   - deltaL = (100 * 13) / 200 = 6; reinvestL = 13 - 6 = 7.
   - deltaL = (100 * 7) / 200 = 3; reinvestL = 7 - 3 = 4.
   - deltaL = (100 * 4) / 200 = 2; reinvestL = 4 - 2 = 2.
   - deltaL = (100 * 2) / 200 = 1; reinvestL = 2 - 1 = 1.
   - deltaL = (100 * 1) / 200 = 0; reinvestL remains 1.

```solidity
    uint256 deltaL = FullMath.mulDivFloor(_qty, reinvestL, totalSupply());
```
6. At the end of the transaction, the attacker repays the flash loan and effectively `gains a certain amount of token0 and token1`.

As a result, `deltaL` becomes zero. Consequently, whenever other users invoke `burnRTokens`, their `R tokens are burnt`, but they `receive no token0 or token1 as a reward`. (after few swaps the reinvestL parameter will become greater and user can repeat the whole attack process)

## Impact
An attacker easily compromise the entire `burnRTokens()` function.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Prevent a single user from making multiple calls to the contract within a single transaction.

Consider checking that calculated `deltaL` and `reinvestL` are reasonable.
