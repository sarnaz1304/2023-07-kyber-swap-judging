# `transferAllTokens` can be used by anyone to steal all of the funds in the `BasePositionManager.sol` and `AntiSnipAttackPositionManager.sol`
## Summary
`transferAllTokens` is used to transfer all the tokens from the `BasePositionManager.sol` and `AntiSnipAttackPositionManager.sol` to the `recipient` , but that function doesn't have any modifier or protection and can be called by anyone and front-ran to steal funds from the contracts.
## Vulnerability Detail
`BasePositionManager.sol` and `AntiSnipAttackPositionManager.sol` is very similar to `NonfungiblePositionManager.sol` from UniswapV3 and acts as a manger where users can mint ERC721 and provide liquidity to pools, earning fees. The big difference between these two is that , the fees earned in Kyber-Swap protocol are earned in form of `RTokens` which can be burned to gain the actual tokens present in the pools. In UniswapV3 you can call `collect` to get transferred directly from the pools, all of the fees earned, but in Kyber-Swap you need to call `burnRTokens` which will transfer the fees earned from the pools to the `BasePositionManager.sol` / `AntiSnipAttackPositionManager.sol` itself, as can be seen here

which will make the fees be in those two contracts. After that if the user wants to actually get his fees earned by his position, he need to call `transferAllTokens` with those two tokens that were transferred from the pools.

which will basically transfer the whole balance of those tokens in the contract

Because of that, anyone can front-run and steal all of the rewards from any user, the only possible way of protecting yourself is by using the `Multicall.sol` contract used, and batch multiple transactions into one, but that it is not a reliable protections against front-run, especially for normal users.
## Impact
Impact is a high one, because funds can be lost

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider transferring directly the fees to the user after you burn the RTokens, keeping the fees in the managers contract and letting everyone to transfer funds from those contracts can be very dangerous in the long run, even one mistake can hurt the users.
