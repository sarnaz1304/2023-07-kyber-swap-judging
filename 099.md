# Anyone can call `RouterTokenHelper.transferAllTokens` to steal protocol fees stored in manager and swap router contracts
## Summary
There are no access control restrictions to `RouterTokenHelper.transferAllTokens` so anyone can call this to steal the KyberSwap v2 Reinvestment Token fees from the `BasePositionManager/AntiSnipAttackPositionManager` contract. 
This function can also be called to steal any tokens from the `Router` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The above contracts inherit from an interface `IRouterTokenHelper`.  RouterTokenHelper has a transferAllTokens() function that has no access control. This allows anyone to transfer any token from these contracts to any recipient.

## Impact
Anyone can take the protocol fees stored in `BasePositionManager/AntiSnipAttackPositionManager`. They can also steal tokens stored in the Swap Router. 

## Code Snippet
BasePositionManager/AntiSnipAttackPositionManager receive KyberSwap v2 Reinvestment Token fees for every `addLiquidity` call. 
```solidity
function _tweakPosition(UpdatePositionData memory posData) {
...
    if (feesClaimable != 0) _transfer(address(this), posData.owner, feesClaimable);
...
}
```

This can be stolen by anyone via `transferAllTokens` because there are no access control restrictions.

```solidity
function transferAllTokens(
    address token,
    uint256 minAmount,
    address recipient
  ) public payable virtual override {
    uint256 balanceToken = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(balanceToken >= minAmount, 'Insufficient token');

    if (balanceToken > 0) {
      TokenHelper.transferToken(IERC20(token), balanceToken, address(this), recipient);
    }
  }
```

Also any tokens can be stolen from the `Router.sol` after a swap is complete where the recipient is set to the router contract. 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove or add access control to the `RouterTokenHelper.transferAllTokens` function.
