# Exposure to Frontrunning of Pool creation
## Summary

There is a potential vulnerability in the process of creating pools using the `CREATE2` opcode. This vulnerability arises from the deterministic nature of the address generation process, which did not consider the `msg.sender`, making the pool creation susceptible to front-running attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [_create function,](https://github.com/KyberNetwork/ks-elastic-sc/blob/4ab08c0a60f74809f731bdd333076e32d05f1d17/contracts/libraries/BaseSplitCodeFactory.sol#L175) designed to deploy contracts using the `CREATE2` opcode, determines the address of the new contract based on certain parameters and a salt. 

An attacker can obtain these parameters watching the mempool and frontrun pool creation. 

## Impact

A user creating a pool can get frontrun by an attacker watching the mempool with a high gas, this result in a gas-griefing attack where the attacker transaction is mined and the victim transaction failed

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to combine salt with msg.sender
