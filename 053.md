# Recipient Misassignment in `swapExactInput` Function
## Summary
The `swapExactInput` function in the contract assumes there are intermediate swaps and assigns the recipient as the contract itself for each step of the swap. However, in cases where there is only one pool involved, this assumption is incorrect and results in output tokens being sent to the contract address instead of the intended recipient.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `swapExactInput` function, the contract assumes there are intermediate swaps in a multi-hop trade and sets the `recipient` to the contract address for each step, regardless of whether there are indeed intermediate swaps.
```solidity
while (true) {
  params.amountIn = _swapExactInputInternal(
    params.amountIn,
    address(this), // Incorrect recipient assignment
    0,
    SwapCallbackData({path: params.path.getFirstPool(), source: source})
  );

  source = address(this);
  params.path = params.path.skipToken();

  if (!params.path.hasMultiplePools()) {
    // Final swap, set recipient to the actual recipient
    amountOut = _swapExactInputInternal(
      params.amountIn,
      params.recipient, // Correct recipient assignment
      0,
      SwapCallbackData({path: params.path, source: source})
    );
    // ...
  }
}

```
Imagine a scenario where a user attempts to perform a token swap using the swapExactInput function in the contract, and there is only one pool involved in the trade. Here's how an attacker could take advantage of the vulnerability:
1.  The user intends to swap a certain amount of Token A for Token B, specifying the exact input amount and providing the recipient's address.
2.  The contract contains the `swapExactInput` function, which assumes that there are intermediate swaps in all cases and assigns the recipient to the contract itself for each step of the trade.
3. Exploitation:
- The attacker observes that there is only one pool involved in the trade.
- They initiate a swap with the contract, specifying Token A as the input, Token B as the output, and their own address as the recipient.
- The contract begins the swap, assuming there are intermediate steps, and assigns the recipient as the contract address for the first step.
- Since there are no intermediate swaps, the final step is reached, and the contract assigns the recipient as the attacker's address for the last step.
 4. The swap is completed, but the output tokens (Token B) are sent to the attacker's address instead of the intended recipient's address. The attacker successfully gains control of the output tokens, resulting in a loss for the user.
 5. Impact: 
 - The user's tokens have been effectively stolen by the attacker due to the incorrect recipient assignment in the contract.
 - The user's intended recipient does not receive the tokens as expected, leading to financial loss and a potential breach of trust.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that when a trade involves only one pool (i.e., there are no intermediate swaps), the `recipient` for each step of the trade is incorrectly set to the contract address. As a result, the output tokens from the trade are sent to the contract instead of being delivered to the intended recipient. This can lead to loss of tokens for users and unexpected behavior in the contract's token transfer functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the contract accurately to assign the recipient based on whether there are multiple pools involved in the trade. This would prevent tokens from being sent to unintended addresses in cases where only one pool is used.
