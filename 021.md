# Frontrunning/Dos possible with pool creation in `Factory.sol`
## Summary
Frontrunning/Dos possible with pool creation in `Factory.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In Factory.sol, createPool() is used to create new pools which is a public function and can be accessed by anyone.

```Solidity
File: ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Factory.sol

  function createPool(
    address tokenA,
    address tokenB,
    uint24 swapFeeUnits
  ) external override returns (address pool) {


   // some code


    pool = _create(bytes(''), keccak256(abi.encode(token0, token1, swapFeeUnits)));

   // some code

  }
```

Here, it has used `_create()` which is taken from `BaseSplitCodeFactory.sol` and can be seen as below,

```Solidity
File: ks-elastic-sc/contracts/libraries/BaseSplitCodeFactory.sol

  function _create(bytes memory constructorArgs, bytes32 salt) internal virtual returns (address) {
    bytes memory creationCode = _getCreationCodeWithArgs(constructorArgs);

    address destination;
    assembly {
>>      destination := create2(0, add(creationCode, 32), mload(creationCode), salt)
    }

    if (destination == address(0)) {
      // Bubble up inner revert reason
      // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
      assembly {
        returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())
        revert(0, returndatasize())
      }
    }

    return destination;
  }
```
Here the salt is a bytes32 value that is used in pool creation call i.e createPool() by the caller. 

Notice here, it has only used arguments such as `token0, token1, swapFeeUnits` for calculating the salt, however such implementation is susceptible to front runnning or it can be Dos. The frontrunning can occur in the following way:

1) When the pool creation is called by caller/deployer. An attacker monitors the mempool for pending transactions that involve cloning a contract with a provided "salt".
2) Upon spotting such a transaction, the attacker extracts the "salt" value.
3) The attacker quickly submits their own transaction with a higher gas price, attempting to clone the contract with the same "salt" before the original transaction is mined.
4) If the transaction got successful, the attacker's transaction is mined first, and the contract clone is created at the expected address.
5) The original transaction will likely fail, as the contract with the expected address has already been deployed. This can be repeated by attacker causing Dos as well as Front running of transactions.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a salt that includes the msg.sender. That way it is not possible to front-run the transaction and Dos can be prevented.

```diff

  function createPool(
    address tokenA,
    address tokenB,
    uint24 swapFeeUnits
  ) external override returns (address pool) {


   // some code

+   bytes32 _salt = keccak256(abi.encode(token0, token1, swapFeeUnits, msg.sender));
-    pool = _create(bytes(''), keccak256(abi.encode(token0, token1, swapFeeUnits)));
+   pool = _create(bytes(''), _salt);
    getPool[token0][token1][swapFeeUnits] = pool;
    // populate mapping in the reverse direction, deliberate choice to avoid the cost of comparing addresses
    getPool[token1][token0][swapFeeUnits] = pool;
    emit PoolCreated(token0, token1, swapFeeUnits, tickDistance, pool);
  }
```
