Brief Amethyst Frog

# (Invalid, can maybe be salvaged if you note that RTokens are spread over whole range) Reinvestment tokens do not compound; frequent burning and re-deposits required to maximize gains
## Summary

It is possible for anyone to cheaply initialize any pool to an absurdly high price.  Bringing it back down to the actual price then costs an absurd amount of gas. Since there can only be a few pools per token pair, this makes it very cheap to render the entire KyberSwap protocol unable to trade any given token pair.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Alice wants to create a Pool between two tokens that normally trade at a 1-1 ratio, with a swap fee of 8 fee units. This pool has a tick distance of 1.
2. Bob front-runs the transaction and creates the pool himself. He initializes the pool to an initialSqrtP of p=845400776793423922697130608897531771147615,  which is the lowest price corresponding to tick 600000. He pays ceil(100 * p / (1<<96)) ~ 0.001e18 of token1, and ceil(100 * (1 << 96) / p) = 1 of token0. (n.B.: If token0 is WETH, that means 1e-18 WETH worth approximately $0, not 1 WETH.)
3. To actually use this pool, Alice will need to pay enough gas to run 600000 iterations of the while loop in the swap function, spread across at least 600000/MAX_TICK_DISTANCE = 1250 different  transactions.

This is such an absurd amount of gas that it, for all intents and purposes, renders the pool useless. Since there can only be a few pools per token pair, this makes it very cheap to render the entire KyberSwap protocol unable to trade any given token pair.
