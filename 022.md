## Summary
In `BaseSplitCodeFactory.sol`, Vulnerability related to ‘Optimizer Bug Regarding Memory Side Effects of Inline Assembly

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

There is an optimizer bug in BaseSplitCodeFactory.sol contract. The bug was introduced in Solidity 0.8.13 with a new Yul optimizer step meant to remove unused writes to memory and storage.

A detailed bug information can be read from below reference-
https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/06/15/inline-assembly-memory-side-effects-bug/

The Yul optimizer considers all memory writes in the outermost Yul block that are never read from as unused and removes them. The bug is fixed in solidity 0.8.15. Here the contract has used floating solidity version [0.8.0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/libraries/BaseSplitCodeFactory.sol#L15)

```Solidity
File: ks-elastic-sc/contracts/libraries/BaseSplitCodeFactory.sol

  function _getCreationCodeWithArgs(bytes memory constructorArgs)
    private
    view
>>  returns (bytes memory code)
  {


  // some code


    assembly {
      // First, we allocate memory for `code` by retrieving the free memory pointer and then moving it ahead of
      // `code` by the size of the creation code plus constructor arguments, and 32 bytes for the array length.
      code := mload(0x40)
>>    mstore(0x40, add(code, add(codeSize, 32)))

      // We now store the length of the code plus constructor arguments.
>>    mstore(code, codeSize)

      // Next, we concatenate the creation code stored in A and B.
      let dataStart := add(code, 32)
      extcodecopy(creationCodeContractA, dataStart, 0, creationCodeSizeA)
      extcodecopy(creationCodeContractB, add(dataStart, creationCodeSizeA), 0, creationCodeSizeB)
    }


  // some code


    }
```
_getCreationCodeWithArgs() function has is an inline assembly block.Here the the written memory is never read from in the same assembly block. It would trigger the bug to remove the memory write.

This bug only occurs under very specific conditions: the legacy optimizer must be enabled rather than the IR pipeline (true for the current project configuration). This is checked in `hardhat.config.ts` and found to be true for the existence of this optimizer bug issue,

```Solidity
File: ks-elastic-sc/hardhat.config.ts

const solcConfig: SolcUserConfig = {
  version: '0.8.9',
  settings: {
    optimizer: {
      enabled: true,
      runs: 100000,
    },
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the solidity version to 0.8.15 or preferably 0.8.19
