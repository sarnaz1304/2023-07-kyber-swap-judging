# Insufficient validation in `flash` mechanism can result in locked funds if the caller overpays whatever he initially owed
## Summary

The `flash` function in the `Pool` contract allows for flash loans. An observed vulnerability arises from inadequate validation of repayment quantities. The consequence of this oversight is that if the caller repays more than they should, these excess funds become trapped within the contract without a mechanism for retrieval.

## Vulnerability Detail

Upon initiating a flash loan using the `flash` function, the contract accurately determines the fee based on `swapFeeUnits`. Nonetheless, the post-callback balance verifications merely ensure that the ending balance surpasses or meets the initial balance added to the required fee. It omits a check against overpayment. Since there's no provision for returning or denying surplus tokens, this creates a scenario where tokens can be permanently stuck.

> Using the subsequent segment of the code for reference:

```solidity
uint256 feeQty0;
uint256 feeQty1;
if (feeTo != address(0)) {
 feeQty0 = (qty0 * swapFeeUnits) / C.FEE_UNITS;
 feeQty1 = (qty1 * swapFeeUnits) / C.FEE_UNITS;
}
```

> Subsequent checks do:

```solidity
require(balance0Before + feeQty0 <= balance0After, 'lacking feeQty0');
require(balance1Before + feeQty1 <= balance1After, 'lacking feeQty1');
```

These verifications only ensure that the repayment isn't below the requisite, but **there's no mechanism against overpayment**.

## Impact

Any participant, whether through intent or error, can repay more than the flash loan's total sum. This oversight would cause the excess funds to become irretrievable, thus leading to possible financial implications for users and impact the platform's trustworthiness.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
  function flash(
    address recipient,
    uint256 qty0,
    uint256 qty1,
    bytes calldata data
  ) external override lock {
    // send all collected fees to feeTo
    (address feeTo, ) = factory.feeConfiguration();
    uint256 feeQty0;
    uint256 feeQty1;
    if (feeTo != address(0)) {
      feeQty0 = (qty0 * swapFeeUnits) / C.FEE_UNITS;
      feeQty1 = (qty1 * swapFeeUnits) / C.FEE_UNITS;
    }
    uint256 balance0Before = _poolBalToken0();
    uint256 balance1Before = _poolBalToken1();

    if (qty0 > 0) token0.safeTransfer(recipient, qty0);
    if (qty1 > 0) token1.safeTransfer(recipient, qty1);

    IFlashCallback(msg.sender).flashCallback(feeQty0, feeQty1, data);

    uint256 balance0After = _poolBalToken0();
    uint256 balance1After = _poolBalToken1();

    require(balance0Before + feeQty0 <= balance0After, 'lacking feeQty0');
    require(balance1Before + feeQty1 <= balance1After, 'lacking feeQty1');

    uint256 paid0;
    uint256 paid1;
    unchecked {
      paid0 = balance0After - balance0Before;
      paid1 = balance1After - balance1Before;
    }

    if (paid0 > 0) token0.safeTransfer(feeTo, paid0);
    if (paid1 > 0) token1.safeTransfer(feeTo, paid1);

    emit Flash(msg.sender, recipient, qty0, qty1, paid0, paid1);
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Incorporate an exact validation method within the repayment mechanism to guarantee that only the loaned amount plus the mandatory fee is accepted. Overages should automatically return to the sender to avert the trapping of funds.

## POC

To demonstrate the exploit:

1. Deploy the `Pool` contract on either a local testnet or a fork of the mainnet.
2. Use the `flash` function to initiate a flash loan.
3. Build a callback function within a test contract meant to interface with the `flash` function. Within this callback, repay an amount exceeding the necessary repayment.
4. Note that the `Pool` contract readily accepts this overpayment.
5. Establish that these excess tokens now reside in the contract and lack any retrieval mechanism.

> Below is a simple callback contract called `CallbackContract` which deliberately overpays when interfacing with the `flash` function from the `Pool` contract.

        bytes calldata data
    ) external;
}

interface IERC20 {
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

contract CallbackContract {
    
    IPool public pool;

    IERC20 public token1;  // ERC20 interface for the second token
    
    constructor(address _pool, address _token0, address _token1) {
        pool = IPool(_pool);
        token0 = IERC20(_token0);
        token1 = IERC20(_token1);
    }
    
    function executeFlashLoan(uint256 qty0, uint256 qty1) external {
        // Request flash loan
        pool.flash(address(this), qty0, qty1, "");
    }
    
    function flashCallback(uint256 feeQty0, uint256 feeQty1, bytes calldata data) external {
        // Ensure only Pool can call this
        require(msg.sender == address(pool), "Callback not from Pool");

        uint256 totalRepay0 = feeQty0 + qty0;
        uint256 totalRepay1 = feeQty1 + qty1;

        // Deliberately overpaying
        token0.transfer(address(pool), totalRepay0 + 1 ether);  // Overpaying by 1 ether for token0
        token1.transfer(address(pool), totalRepay1 + 1 ether);  // Overpaying by 1 ether for token1
    }
}
```

> And the javacript...

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Make sure to replace with the address of your deployed Pool contract
    const PoolAddress = "YOUR_POOL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE";
    const pool = await ethers.getContractAt("Pool", PoolAddress);

    // Define the desired loan amounts
    const qty0 = ethers.utils.parseEther("10");
    const qty1 = ethers.utils.parseEther("10");

    // Fetch addresses of tokens involved in the Pool flash mechanism
    // NOTE: Replace the placeholders with actual token addresses
    const token0Address = "YOUR_TOKEN0_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE";
    const token1Address = "YOUR_TOKEN1_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE";

    // Deploy the callback contract
    const CallbackContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("CallbackContract");
    const callbackContract = await CallbackContractFactory.deploy(PoolAddress, token0Address, token1Address);

    // Execute flash loan with the deliberate overpayment
    await callbackContract.executeFlashLoan(qty0, qty1);

    // Check for the excess tokens now stuck in the Pool contract
    const balanceAfter = await pool._poolBalToken0(); // Assuming ERC20 token as an example
    console.log("Excess tokens in Pool:", ethers.utils.formatEther(balanceAfter.sub(qty0)));
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

> In the above JavaScript code:

1. Placeholder values for Pool and token contract addresses have been emphasized. Replace them with actual contract addresses before execution.
2. The `executeFlashLoan` function of the `CallbackContract` is modified to not accept the `poolAddress` parameter since the address is already initialized in the constructor.

> For instance, to make the POC functional:
- Deploy the `Pool` contract.
- Deploy two ERC20 token contracts or use pre-existing ones.
- Fund the `CallbackContract` with sufficient ERC20 tokens to cover the flash loan and overpayment.
- Replace the placeholder values in the JavaScript code with actual contract addresses.
- Run the script to observe the vulnerability in action.
