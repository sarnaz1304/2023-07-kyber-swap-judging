# `getTickAtSqrtRatio` and `mulDivFloor` function from `TickMath.sol` and `FullMath.sol` require overflow behavior and can render the contracts unusable
## Summary
The function `getTickAtSqrtRatio` and `mulDivFloor` are used in multiple instances in the contract and those functions require overflow behavior, which will not happen, and can render multiple contracts unusable.
## Vulnerability Detail
`getTickAtSqrtRatio` from `TickMath.sol` is taked from UniswapV3 `TickMath` library, as can be seen here 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/libraries/TickMath.sol#L69-L214
https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/libraries/TickMath.sol#L61-L204
and `mulDivFloor` was taken from UniswapV3 `FullMath` library 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol#L15-L110
https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/libraries/FullMath.sol#L14-L106
but libraries were made for compiler version less than 0.8.0, since it expects overflow behavior to work properly, but the instances where those functions were used in Kyber-Swap protocol are in contracts that are compiled with solidity version bigger than 0.8.0, which doesn't let overflow happen. `mulDivFloor`, for example, is used in most of the important functionalities in the contracts like `Pool.sol`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L452
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L640
## Impact
Impact is a high one since it can render the contracts like `Pool.sol`, `BasePositionManager.sol` , `AntiSnipAttackPositionManager.sol` unusable and loss of funds can occur in case of reverts of multiple fuctionalities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use unchecked boxes in those two functions, since that is the way UniswapV3 solves this issues in their libraries.
