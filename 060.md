# Lack of Error Handling in `_transferTokens` Function
## Summary
The `_transferTokens` function in the provided contract does not include proper error handling when transferring tokens. This omission could lead to unintended consequences and unexpected behavior in the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_transferTokens` function is designed to transfer tokens, either WETH (Wrapped Ether) or other ERC-20 tokens, from one address (the sender) to another address (the recipient). However, it lacks error handling, which can result in issues when token transfers fail.
```solidity
function _transferTokens(
    address token,
    address sender,
    address recipient,
    uint256 tokenAmount
) internal {
    if (token == WETH && address(this).balance >= tokenAmount) {
        IWETH(WETH).deposit{value: tokenAmount}();
        IWETH(WETH).transfer(recipient, tokenAmount); // No error handling here
    } else {
        TokenHelper.transferToken(IERC20(token), tokenAmount, sender, recipient); // No error handling here
    }
}
```
## Impact
If a token transfer fails due to reasons such as insufficient gas, a faulty token contract, or any other unforeseen issue, the contract will continue execution without providing feedback or reverting the transaction. This could lead to a loss of tokens or unexpected behavior in the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Proper error handling should be added to the `_transferTokens` function:
```solidity
function _transferTokens(
    address token,
    address sender,
    address recipient,
    uint256 tokenAmount
) internal {
    if (token == WETH && address(this).balance >= tokenAmount) {
        IWETH(WETH).deposit{value: tokenAmount}();
        bool success = IWETH(WETH).transfer(recipient, tokenAmount);
        require(success, 'WETH transfer failed'); // Error handling for WETH transfer
    } else {
        bool success = TokenHelper.transferToken(IERC20(token), tokenAmount, sender, recipient);
        require(success, 'Token transfer failed'); // Error handling for token transfer
    }
}
```
