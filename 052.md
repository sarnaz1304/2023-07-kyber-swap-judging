# Anyone can take unclaimed tokens from a PositionManager
## Summary

When someone leaves a position managed by either a BasePositionManager or AntiSnipPositionManager, they must first call `burnRTokens` or `removeLiquidity`, which transfers tokens from the pool to the PositionManager. The owner must then call transferAllTokens. Anyone who beats them to that call can steal these tokens. This is particularly bad for positions owned by EOAs, which cannotcall both removeLiquidity and transferAllTokens  in the same transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail

The documentation for BurnRTokenParams reads "Burn the rTokens to get back token0 + token1 as fees." In fact, BurnRToken does not give back token0 + token1 as fees. It instead leaves them on the PositionManager. Whoever calls `transferAllTokens` first shall receive the fees.

A similar thing happens for removeLiquidity; it leaves token0 and token1 on the position manager, to be claimed by anyone.

## Impact

Users can have their funds stolen

## Code Snippet

E.g.: BasePositionManager.burnRTokens does not send tokens to owner: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/periphery/BasePositionManager.sol#L242

This is  even though Pool.burnRTokens does send tokens to the sender, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/Pool.sol#L289 . This means the tokens will be left on the PositionManager contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Transfer tokens to owner directly; do not wait for them to call transferAllTokens.
