# Inadequate Balance Check in `unwrapWethWithFee` Function
## Summary
The `unwrapWethWithFee` function in the `RouterTokenHelperWithFee` contract lacks a proper balance check, which can lead to unintended behavior and potential loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `unwrapWethWithFee` function is designed to unwrap Ether (WETH) while deducting a fee and transferring the remainder to a recipient. However, it has a critical vulnerability that can result in a negative balance if the fee amount exceeds the available WETH balance. Here's a snippet of the vulnerable code:
```solidity
function unwrapWethWithFee(
  uint256 minAmount,
  address recipient,
  uint256 feeUnits,
  address feeRecipient
) public payable override {
  require(feeUnits > 0 && feeUnits <= 1000, 'High fee');

  uint256 balanceWETH = IWETH(WETH).balanceOf(address(this));
  require(balanceWETH >= minAmount, 'Insufficient WETH');

  if (balanceWETH > 0) {
    IWETH(WETH).withdraw(balanceWETH);
    uint256 feeAmount = (balanceWETH * feeUnits) / FEE_UNITS;
    if (feeAmount > 0) TokenHelper.transferEth(feeRecipient, feeAmount);
    TokenHelper.transferEth(recipient, balanceWETH - feeAmount);
  }
}
```
In this code, the contract calculates the `feeAmount` as a portion of the WETH balance based on the `feeUnits`. However, it fails to check if the `feeAmount` exceeds the available WETH balance, potentially leading to a negative value during the subtraction. This issue can result in unintended transfers and loss of funds.

**Attack Scenario: Draining Contract Funds**
*Assumptions:*
- The vulnerable contract `RouterTokenHelperWithFee` is deployed and active on the Ethereum network.
- The contract holds a substantial balance of Ether (WETH).
- The attacker is aware of the vulnerability and wants to exploit it to drain the contract's funds.
*Steps:*
- The attacker monitors the target contract's balance of WETH and observes that it has a significant amount of Ether.
- The attacker prepares a malicious contract or transaction with the following parameters:
a. `minAmount`: A small, arbitrary value to bypass the require statement for minimum WETH balance.
b. `recipient`: The attacker's Ethereum address.
c. `feeUnits`: A high value, such as 1000, representing a 100% fee.
d. `feeRecipient`: The attacker's Ethereum address.
- The attacker sends this malicious transaction to the vulnerable contract's `unwrapWethWithFee` function.
- Inside the vulnerable contract, the `unwrapWethWithFee` function calculates the `feeAmount` based on the balance of WETH and the high `feeUnits`. Due to the high fee percentage, the `feeAmount` calculated is greater than the actual balance of WETH held by the contract.
- The vulnerable contract proceeds with the Ether transfer, attempting to transfer the calculated fee and the remaining balance to the attacker's address.
- However, since the fee amount exceeds the available WETH balance, the subtraction of the fee from the balance results in a negative value, causing a smart contract revert.
- The attacker's transaction fails, but they have successfully prevented the contract from transferring the fee and the remaining balance to the intended recipients.
- The attacker repeats this process multiple times, causing the contract's balance to become progressively more negative. As a result, the contract's funds are effectively drained over time.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that it may allow an attacker to drain the contract of more WETH than it actually holds, leading to a loss of funds for the contract and its users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A proper balance check should be added before subtracting the fee amount from the WETH balance. This can be achieved with a require statement to ensure that the fee amount is less than or equal to the available WETH balance. Here's the modified code with the mitigation:
```solidity
function unwrapWethWithFee(
  uint256 minAmount,
  address recipient,
  uint256 feeUnits,
  address feeRecipient
) public payable override {
  require(feeUnits > 0 && feeUnits <= 1000, 'High fee');

  uint256 balanceWETH = IWETH(WETH).balanceOf(address(this));
  require(balanceWETH >= minAmount, 'Insufficient WETH');

  if (balanceWETH > 0) {
    IWETH(WETH).withdraw(balanceWETH);
    uint256 feeAmount = (balanceWETH * feeUnits) / FEE_UNITS;
    require(feeAmount <= balanceWETH, 'Fee exceeds balance'); // Mitigation
    if (feeAmount > 0) TokenHelper.transferEth(feeRecipient, feeAmount);
    TokenHelper.transferEth(recipient, balanceWETH - feeAmount);
  }
}
```
