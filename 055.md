# Potential Expired Permit Issue When Using `DeadlineValidation` in External Contracts
## Summary
Contracts that import and use the `DeadlineValidation` abstract contract may face a high risk of inadvertently using expired permits when performing actions like swaps, especially in scenarios involving multi-hop trades.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the use of the `DeadlineValidation` abstract contract in external contracts, such as the provided `Router` contract. When external contracts incorporate `DeadlineValidation`, they rely on the `block.timestamp` for validating transaction deadlines. Here is a specific code snippet from the DeadlineValidation abstract contract:

```solidity
modifier onlyNotExpired(uint256 deadline) {
    require(_blockTimestamp() <= deadline, 'Expired');
    _;
}
```
```solidity
function _blockTimestamp() internal view virtual returns (uint256) {
    return block.timestamp;//@audit-ok
  }
```
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/periphery/Router.sol#L91-L120)
```solidity
 function swapExactInput(ExactInputParams memory params)
    external
    payable
    override
    onlyNotExpired(params.deadline) <<<<@
    returns (uint256 amountOut)
  {
    address source = msg.sender; // msg.sender is the source of tokenIn for the first swap

    while (true) {
      bool hasMultiplePools = params.path.hasMultiplePools();

      params.amountIn = _swapExactInputInternal(
        params.amountIn,
        hasMultiplePools ? address(this) : params.recipient, // for intermediate swaps, this contract custodies
        0,
        SwapCallbackData({path: params.path.getFirstPool(), source: source})
      );

      if (hasMultiplePools) {
        source = address(this);
        params.path = params.path.skipToken();
      } else {
        amountOut = params.amountIn;
        break;
      }
    }

    require(amountOut >= params.minAmountOut, 'Router: insufficient amountOut');
  }

```
This issue occurs because the `onlyNotExpired` modifier, which relies on `block.timestamp`, is applied at different stages of the transaction. If the assumption about intermediate swaps is incorrect, the expiration check might not behave as expected, potentially allowing the use of expired permits.

## Impact
 The use of an expired permit can lead to unexpected behavior within the contract's functions. For example, in the context of swaps, if an expired permit is accepted, tokens may be transferred to the contract even though the permit should have been rejected. This behavior can confuse users and disrupt the expected flow of the application.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enhance the deadline validation mechanism by incorporating additional checks and validations beyond `block.timestamp`. Consider using decentralized oracles to fetch a more tamper-resistant timestamp or time-related data. These oracles can provide a trusted source of time information that is less susceptible to manipulation by miners.
