# Return values of transfer() not checked
## Summary
Not all ERC20 implementations revert() when there's a failure in ```transfer()```. The function signature has a boolean return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually transfer anything.

## Impact
The transfer may get failed but we didn't check it and we assumed it as a success. 

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/periphery/base/RouterTokenHelper.sol#L58-L59

```solidity
/// @dev Transfer tokenAmount amount of token from the sender to the recipient
  function _transferTokens(
    address token,
    address sender,
    address recipient,
    uint256 tokenAmount
  ) internal {
    if (token == WETH && address(this).balance >= tokenAmount) {
      IWETH(WETH).deposit{value: tokenAmount}();
      IWETH(WETH).transfer(recipient, tokenAmount);
    } else {
      TokenHelper.transferToken(IERC20(token), tokenAmount, sender, recipient);
    }
  }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the value of transfer function or use ```saferTransfer``` instead
