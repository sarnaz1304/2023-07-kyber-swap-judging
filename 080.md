# initializers can be front run
## Summary
initializers for upgradeable contracts can be front run 

## Vulnerability Detail
[TokenPositionDescriptor.sol has an initialize function that is not protected line 18](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-kyber-swap/blob/main/ks-elastic-sc/contracts/periphery/TokenPositionDescriptor.sol#L19) such that owner becomes the Owner of the contracts.

## Impact
 If the function is front run by malicious actor observing call and they call with higher gas they become owner of TokenPositionDescriptor.sol taking control of the contract 

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
 function initialize() public initializer {
    __Ownable_init();
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to ensure initialize is called immediately on deployment using various plugins or add access control tot he initialize function, additionally bes practise to call _disableInitializers();
```solidity 
constructor() {
   _disableInitializers();
}
```
