# Use _safetransfer() instead of _transfer()
## Summary
The use of _transfer() in the function for transferring funds cannot guarantee the successful transfer of funds. This is because _transfer() always returns a true or false value for the transaction and does not revert the function in case of an unsuccessful transfer.
## Vulnerability Detail
The _transfer() function always returns a boolean value (true or false) for the transaction. If the transaction fails for any reason, it will return false but will not revert the function.
## Impact
This can result in funds not being transferred to the destination address while allowing the function to execute completely.

## Recommendation
It is recommended to replace _transfer() with _safetransfer() to ensure safer and more reliable fund transfers. _safetransfer() is designed to revert the transaction in case of failure, providing better assurance of successful fund transfers.
