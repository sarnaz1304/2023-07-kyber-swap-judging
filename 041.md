# Missing Contract Existence Check in Multicall Contract
## Summary
The Multicall contract lacks a crucial contract existence check before executing `delegatecall`. This omission can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided Multicall contract, the multicall function is designed to execute multiple external contract calls using `delegatecall`. However, there is no verification of the existence of the target contract before performing the delegate call. This poses a vulnerability because the EVM returns true for a successful `delegatecall` even if the target contract does not exist, as part of its design.
```solidity
function multicall(bytes[] calldata data)
  external
  payable
  override
  returns (bytes[] memory results)
{
  results = new bytes[](data.length);
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    address target = /* calculate the target address */;
    
    // No check for the existence of the target contract before delegatecall

    (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);

    if (!success) {
      // Handle errors
      revert("Delegatecall failed");
    }
    results[i] = result;
  }
}

```
## Impact
The contract may behave unexpectedly when calling a non-existent contract via `delegatecall`. Instead of failing as expected, the `delegatecall` will return true for success, potentially leading to unintended consequences or vulnerabilities in the contract's logic.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a contract existence check using the `extcodesize` opcode or the `address.exists()` pattern. 
```solidity
// ...

function multicall(bytes[] calldata data)
  external
  payable
  override
  returns (bytes[] memory results)
{
  results = new bytes[](data.length);
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    address target = /* calculate the target address */;
    
    // Check if the target contract exists before making the delegatecall
    require(extcodesize(target) > 0, "Target contract does not exist");

    (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);

    if (!success) {
      // Handle errors
      revert("Delegatecall failed");
    }
    results[i] = result;
  }
}

// ...
