# Input Validation Vulnerability
## Summary
This audit report highlights potential vulnerabilities and areas of concern found during a manual review of the provided smart contract. The contract contains instances of inadequate input validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities, and potential financial losses if not addressed.
## Vulnerability Detail
### Input Validation Issues
1. **Unchecked LiquidityDelta**: In functions like `_updateLiquidityAndCrossTick`, `liquidityDelta` is applied directly without checking whether the resulting liquidity exceeds the `maxTickLiquidity`. This could potentially lead to an overflow and undesirable behavior in the contract.
2. **Untested Tick Range**: The contract uses tick values without ensuring they fall within acceptable ranges (e.g., `MIN_TICK` and `MAX_TICK`). Incorrect tick values might cause unexpected behavior and issues during calculations.
## Impact
If the input validation issues are not addressed, the contract may exhibit unintended behavior, potential arithmetic overflows, and incorrect liquidity calculations. This could lead to a mismanagement of liquidity, inaccurate fee calculations, and other unforeseen issues that may result in financial losses or instability in the contract.
## Code Snippet
Example of unchecked liquidityDelta:
```solidity
 function _updateLiquidityAndCrossTick(
    int24 nextTick,
    uint128 currentLiquidity,
    uint256 feeGrowthGlobal,
    uint128 secondsPerLiquidityGlobal,
    bool willUpTick
  ) internal returns (uint128 newLiquidity, int24 newNextTick) {
    unchecked {
      ticks[nextTick].feeGrowthOutside = feeGrowthGlobal - ticks[nextTick].feeGrowthOutside;
      ticks[nextTick].secondsPerLiquidityOutside =
        secondsPerLiquidityGlobal -
        ticks[nextTick].secondsPerLiquidityOutside;
    }
    int128 liquidityNet = ticks[nextTick].liquidityNet;
    if (willUpTick) {
      newNextTick = initializedTicks[nextTick].next;
    } else {
      newNextTick = initializedTicks[nextTick].previous;
      liquidityNet = -liquidityNet;
    }
    newLiquidity = LiqDeltaMath.applyLiquidityDelta(
      currentLiquidity,
      liquidityNet >= 0 ? uint128(liquidityNet) : liquidityNet.revToUint128(),
      liquidityNet >= 0
    );
  }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
To address the input validation issues and enhance the security of the contract, the following recommendations are provided:
1. **Validate LiquidityDelta**: Implement a check to ensure that the calculated `liquidityDelta` does not result in a liquidity value exceeding `maxTickLiquidity`. This can be done using an `assert` statement or a `require` statement.
2. **Validate Tick Range**: Before using tick values in calculations, ensure that they fall within the acceptable range of tick values, such as `MIN_TICK` and `MAX_TICK`. Use appropriate `require` statements to enforce these checks.
By implementing these recommendations, you can enhance the contract's security, prevent unexpected behavior, and mitigate potential vulnerabilities related to input validation.
