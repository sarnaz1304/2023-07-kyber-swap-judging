# Inaccurate Observations Due to Incorrect `time` and `tick` Parameters in Oracle Library
## Summary
The Oracle library includes the `observe` and `observeSingle` functions that provide historical price data observations. However, these functions assume specific parameters, including the `time` parameter being the current block timestamp and the `tick` parameter being the current `tick` of the pool. Deviating from these assumptions may lead to inaccurate accumulator values for historical observations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises from assumptions made by the Oracle library's `observe` and `observeSingle` functions regarding the `time` and `tick` parameters. Let's delve into the details:
1. `time` Parameter Assumption:
- The Oracle library assumes that the `time` parameter passed to these functions corresponds to the current block timestamp.
- The `Oracle.lte` function, used internally, requires `a` and `b` to be chronologically before the `time` parameter.
- If an arbitrary `time` parameter is used that does not match the current block timestamp, it can lead to incorrect results for the accumulator.
2. `tick` Parameter Assumption:
- The Oracle library assumes that the `tick` parameter is the current tick of the pool.
- If the last observation needed to be transformed (e.g., due to a change in the block timestamp), using an arbitrary `tick` value could result in an incorrect accumulator value.
## Impact
The impact of this issue is that using incorrect or arbitrary values for the `time` and `tick` parameters when calling the `observe` and `observeSingle` functions can result in observations that do not accurately reflect the actual historical price data. This can potentially lead to incorrect decisions or calculations based on the inaccurate data.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- For the `time` parameter, use the timestamp that aligns with the specific point in time you are interested in when retrieving historical price data. This timestamp should be within the valid range of observations stored in the Oracle library.

- For the `tick` parameter, use the tick value that corresponds to the specific time for which you are requesting observations. If the last observation required transformation (i.e., the block timestamp changed), ensure that you use the updated tick value to calculate the accumulator accurately.
