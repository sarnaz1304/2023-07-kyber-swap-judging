# Incorrect Check on `recoveredAddress` in `permit()` Function
## Summary
The `permit` function in the `ERC721Permit` contract contains an incorrect check on the `recoveredAddress`, potentially allowing for unintended approvals of the zero address.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `permit` function of the `ERC721Permit` contract, there is a vulnerability that arises from an incomplete check on the `recoveredAddress`. Let's examine the relevant code snippet:
```solidity
require(recoveredAddress != address(0), 'Invalid signature');
require(recoveredAddress == owner, 'Unauthorized');
```
The purpose of these checks is to ensure that the `recoveredAddress` is a valid Ethereum address and that it matches the owner of the token (`owner`). However, the vulnerability lies in the fact that the code only checks that `recoveredAddress` is not the zero address (`address(0)`) and then assumes it is a valid address. This assumption is incorrect.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that it could allow an attacker to craft a valid signature with the zero address as the `recoveredAddress`. As a result, the attacker can create permits that approve token transfers to the zero address, which is often unintended and can lead to the loss of tokens.
