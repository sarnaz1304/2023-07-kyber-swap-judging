# Lack of Explicit Account Existence Check in Multicall Contract
## Summary
The Multicall contract lacks an explicit check for the existence of the target account before executing a `delegatecall`. This omission could lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The Multicall contract provides a multicall function that allows batch execution of multiple contract function calls using `delegatecall`. However, it does not explicitly check whether the target account (contract) exists before making the `delegatecall`. This omission is problematic because, according to the design of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), `delegatecall` returns true even if the target account does not exist or if the specified function does not exist on the target contract. As a result, the lack of an account existence check may lead to unintended consequences and pose security risks.
```solidity
function multicall(bytes[] calldata data)
    external
    payable
    override
    returns (bytes[] memory results)
{
    results = new bytes[](data.length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
        (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(data[i]);

        if (!success) {
            // Error handling code...
        }
        results[i] = result;
    }
}
```
## Impact
The lack of an explicit account existence check in the Multicall contract can have a significant impact. If the target account does not exist or the specified function is missing, the `delegatecall` will still return `true`, but it may produce unexpected results or consume unnecessary gas. This can lead to erroneous behavior in smart contracts that rely on the Multicall contract for batch function execution.

## Recommendation
Consider adding a check to validate that the callee of a `delegatecall` is indeed a contract, you may refer to the [Address](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/7ac4349710d3b242dd3ceea3200f1298f1c3d2b3/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L40) library by OZ.
